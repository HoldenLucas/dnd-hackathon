BRIAN MURPHY: Hey, guys! It’s Murph, your Dungeon Master. I’m gonna be running the game for the podcast and for my players — Emily, Jake, and Caldwell — but first I wanna real-quick plug our projects.

Emily and I wrote a satirical relationship-advice book called ‘HEY, U UP?: How to Turn Your Booty Call into Your Emergency Contact’; it’s out now and you can get it on Amazon. Check out Caldwell on YouTube.com/Drawfee, as well as on his podcast, ‘What Should We Draw?’ with Nathan Yaffe. And, of course, listen to ‘If I Were You’ with Jake & Amir.

There you go! Plugs over, let’s get into it! Let’s get into the backstory for this campaign, because it wouldn’t be Dungeons & Dragons without me dumping a whole bunch of lore on you up top. So, without further ado, I welcome you to the realm of Bahumia.

[epic music plays]

MURPH: A few years ago, an evil necromancer attempted to conquer the realm in the name of Asmodeus, ruler of the nine hells — but he met his match against three legendary heroes: Thiala, the human Cleric; Ulfgar, the dwarf Fighter; and Alonis, the elf Wizard. After a valiant campaign, the heroes amassed a great army and defeated the necromancer on the battlefield, then traveled to the nine hells and destroyed Asmodeus himself.

The realm rejoiced… for a little while. Then everything started sucking ass again.

The three heroes did everything you’re supposed to do in a D&D campaign: they convinced the isolationist high elves to join the war, they restored a rightful heir to his throne, and they toppled the dark kingdom… but those actions all have consequences. The high elves are now on the verge of extinction, the rightful king is a terrible politician, and the orcs without a homeland have split off into nomadic clans and cause more trouble than they did before.

This is a morally-grey post-war world that still has its share of problems; many of them caused by the very heroes who quote-unquote ‘saved it’. To make matters worse, Thiala, Ulfgar, and Alonis have gone into hiding and haven’t been seen in over a year. Now my players are gonna try and clean up their mess.

Welcome to the campaign after the campaign — this is Not Another D&D Podcast! Let’s meet our party:

JAKE HURWITZ: [as Hardwon; gruff voice] Hardwon Surefoot, the bastard of the mountain: a human Fighter raised by dwarves. Thick of calf and quad, six-foot-six of muscle and beard. The greataxe of Irondeep. Pride of the dwarphanage. Having dug further into Irondeep than any man or dwarf before him, Hardwon believes his next great adventure lies above-ground and has set off to see the world.

CALDWELL TANNER: [as Beverly; high-pitched, excited voice] Beverly Toegold, pure-hearted halfling youth from the city of Galaderon. A five-leaf Green Teen novice Paladin in pursuit of the ultimate merit patches! Beverly has never disobeyed his mom, and is an extremely good boy.

EMILY AXFORD: [as Moonshine; southern drawl] Moonshine Cybin, Crick-elf Druid; lover of fungus and ambassador of decay. Her people were ostracized by the high elves to the dank shores of The Crick, but now sumthin’s amiss at the ol’ Crick! Accompanied by her loyal possum, PawPaw Gump! Freckled, ferocious, and dangerously fertile.

MURPH: Welcome to the first episode of the podcast, everyone!

[Emily applauds and cheers]

JAKE: Alright!

MURPH: I’m your Dungeon Master, Brian Murphy, joined by Jake Hurwitz, Caldwell Tanner, Emily Axford — guys, we’re doin’ it!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Let’s get crackin’!

JAKE: [unintelligible crosstalk]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] It’s finally happening.

MURPH: Jake, your first D&D session ever — and it’s being recorded.

JAKE: [laughs; pained voice] I’m so excited.

[all laugh]

JAKE: I gotta… just like, this isn’t a podcast to me. I’m just here for the fuckin’… for the journey, man.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: [imitating Jake] “I’m here for the rolls.”

JAKE: Yeah, also: Jake Hurwitz is not on this podcast, it’s Hardwon Surefoot.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Oh, shit. Fully in-character.

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] That’s right.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah, that’s true — Emily Axford is DEAD. She’s six feet under.

[all laugh]

MURPH: So let me tell you guys a little bit about this place that you guys are going, and then you guys can tell the audience why your character is going to this village.

JAKE: Ooh!

MURPH: So you guys are going to the fishing village of Moonstone.

[ambient music plays]

MURPH: So, the village of Moonshine was founded fifty years ago by an old halfling druid named Thistle. She was a hermit who placed a powerful magic trident at the bottom of the bay, which lured in all sorts of aquatic creatures from the sea and made for easy fishing. So, soon the bay started to attract other settlers, and Moonstone grew from Thistle’s singular little hut to a bustling village. But, just as it was growing and establishing trade with nearby settlements, an evil dragon named Shadowfang took residence in an old abandoned keep in the swamp to the north of the village, and began terrorizing them.

So, Shadowfang would send her henchmen — the lowly, dragon-worshiping kobolds — to, like, collect gifts and taxes from the villagers under the threat of violence. Then that all changed two years ago, when the legendary party of three heroes arrived at Moonstone, killed Shadowfang, freed the village from the grip of the dragon, and inadvertently left them open to a whole new slough of problems.

JAKE: Oh, fuck.

EMILY: Can I ask a real quick question?

MURPH: Please.

EMILY: Where is Shadowfang’s bod now?

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: You don’t know.

EMILY: Really!?

MURPH: You know— I mean, you know that he’s dead. His bones, like, you—

EMILY: [crosstalk] I wanna find his skeleton and animate it. [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Yeah, dude!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Wait — he or she?

MURPH: She! Sorry, she. She.

JAKE: Okay.

EMILY: Oh! It’s a girl dragon!?

MURPH: It’s a lady dragon.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh.

MURPH: [crosstalk] A lady dragon.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah, bitch! Qween! Bow down! [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] How do you tell a lady dragon from a male dragon?

MURPH: [crosstalk] She has a big pussy instead of a big dick.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Huge tits. [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] Whoa! Huge dragon pussy!

MURPH: Just a huge dragon pussy.

EMILY: Just, yeah. Fire comes out of it, also.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] That’s how you know when she’s read-ayyy. [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] No, yeah. A fire-queef. [farting noise; laughs]

MURPH: A male dragon has enormous, human-like testicles…

CALDWELL: Right. Just swingin’. [laughs]

MURPH: …and a giant, thick penis.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] It’s like, she didn’t have one of those.

JAKE: [crosstalk] That’s the part you don’t see in Lord of the Rings.

MURPH: Right. [laughs]

EMILY: ‘Cuz they’re always sitting on gold, so you can’t see!

JAKE:[crosstalk] That’s right; they’re always fucking the gold.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah. Yeah, they’re— [laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] This is the truth that Tolkien won’t tell you:

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

MURPH: — is that dragons have dicks and pussies.

[all laugh]

Advertisement

JAKE: You know those, like… the movie where you just see the shadow of the dragon flying?

CALDWELL: Yeah.

[all laugh]

JAKE: [crosstalk] — but there’s like a flapping dick behind him.

MURPH: [crosstalk] A dick, waving in the air!

EMILY: It just… first it, like, slowly comes in: you see the flapping wings, and then behind it a flapping dick. [laughs]

JAKE: God, I would love to see just somebody recutting this. [laughs] Adding dicks on dragons would be really funny.

CALDWELL: I think on the journey to Moonstone Beverly’s reading a book about dragons, ‘cuz he’s probably interested in the lore of Shadowfang.

MURPH: Yeah.

CALDWELL: — and he’s like underlining that passage.

EMILY: Ooh! What is—

MURPH: It’s funny; as I was prepping for this, I was worried. I was like, “They’re gonna ask stupid questions like ‘how do dragons breed’ or something, and I’m gonna need something…”

CALDWELL: Uh-huh. [laughs]

MURPH: — but I was like, “You know what? No, it’ll be safe,” but — no. Now dragons have dicks and pussies, okay!?

[all laugh]

JAKE: Yeah! [laughs] 

MURPH: You fuckin’ stumped me; they have dicks.

EMILY: Can I just go back to Beverly highlighting his copy?

CALDWELL: Mhm.

EMILY: Can we just assume you’re using some kind of, like, berry to highlight?

JAKE: [laughs] Oh, that’s cool.

EMILY: Like, there’s some kind of berry that you’re just squeezing to highlight.

Advertisement

CALDWELL: [laughs] Absolutely.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Got a bush full of highlighter-berries.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] No, it’s probably like… it’s, like, a lightning bug.

EMILY: Ooh! [laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah, I’ve got, like, a quill with lightning bug ink.

MURPH: So, guys, why are— Moonshine, why are you going to Moonstone?

EMILY: Okay. So, as I’ve mentioned, I come from The Crick. Something’s amiss at The Crick. But there’s another thing too, which is that…

JAKE: [laughs; imitating Moonshine] “Sumthin’s amiss at The Crick.”

EMILY: [laughs] Sumthin’s amiss at The Crick! But I also am— basically, like… real-quick background on the Crick-elves: they are a maternal society. There’s one MeeMaw who gives birth to all the young’uns.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: — and Moonshine has a lot of pressure to become the next MeeMaw, because she’s so fertile, but she’s not ready to make young’uns — she wants to spread spores. So I’m kind of like using the fact that something’s amiss at The Crick as, like, a reason to go out and adventure and not have to just be a young’un-maker.

MURPH: Right.

CALDWELL: Right.

MURPH: And why is Beverly going to Moonstone?

CALDWELL: Beverly’s going to Moonstone to meet up with the rest of his troop, ‘cuz there is a Green Teen jamboree!

[all laugh]

MURPH: A Green Teen Jamboreen, weirdly, is what it’s called.

CALDWELL: A Green Teen Jamboreen!

MURPH: — that’s what the flyers said.

CALDWELL: That’s what all—

EMILY: Oh, my God; Moonshine’s gonna see that flyer and be like, “Oh, a jamboree!? Alright!”

Advertisement

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh. [imitating Moonshine] “Oh boy! Jamboreen!” I’m gonna buy the t-shirt—

MURPH: [crosstalk] I love that Hardwon and Moonshine are both going there to, like, satisfy their wanderlust…

JAKE: Right.

MURPH: — and Caldwell’s character just has a Boy Scout meeting.

CALDWELL: Yeah!

EMILY: Yeah, he’s, like, literally on a field trip.

JAKE: [imitating Beverly] “It’s a Teen meetup!”

CALDWELL: Oh, no—

MURPH: Really, he’s the only one who actually has a reason to be there. Everyone is like… they’re walkin’ around, and went to this town!

[Jake & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: Yeah, I believe my parents were a little concerned about me going to Moonstone, because it’s, you know, gotten a little less safe over the years, but my scoutmaster — who I’m meeting there — helped convince them that it would be fine because, y’know, like… there’s gonna be a lot of adults present, there’s gonna be a lot of chaperones…

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: — and at the Jamboreen I’m’ going to be working to earn a lot of the last patches that I need for my six-leaf.

MURPH: [crosstalk] They’re gonna be so proud of you.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Quick question, quick question…

CALDWELL:[crosstalk] Yes, yes!

EMILY: Are there girls that are gonna be at the Jamboreen, or is this sort of an all-boy dance? [laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] There are girls in the Green Teens. There are.

CALDWELL:[crosstalk] I think there— I think it’s a— yeah.

EMILY: Oh, there are?

MURPH: Yeah, they pushed for it, and… y’know.

EMILY: Whoa…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] It’s a recent—

JAKE: [crosstalk] Bahumia is the world I want to live in!

EMILY: [crosstalk] I know!

MURPH: [crosstalk] There were some more homophobic, sexist halflings that didn’t want to let them in, but…

CALDWELL: Right.

MURPH: — they kinda got ousted.

EMILY: Whoa…

CALDWELL: I mean, yeah. Green Teens is still a super-religious organization…

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Yeah.

CALDWELL: — but they are gender-neutral.

MURPH: Their Cub Scouts are still called ‘Boy Pals’, even though there are some girl pals in there.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Right. Uh-huh.

EMILY: [laughs] ‘Gal Pals’! ‘Gal Pals’.

MURPH: So, Hardwon, why are you going to Moonstone?

JAKE: Hardwon left the mountain thinking that he was going to walk into anytime and be well-received — like, with a parade…

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: — and instantly found out that nobody knew who he was, and all the hotels were full.

[Murph & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Sort of a jacked Jesus, if you will.

[all laugh]

JAKE: Yeah. [laughs] He went in assuming he’d have a free room somewhere, and they were like, “Uh, you need a reservation, we’re full, you don’t have enough money…”

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: So many factors.

JAKE: He didn’t know what to do, and now he’s wandered off the road. He’s thinking he might try and look for a fishing job in this village.

CALDWELL: Huh.

MURPH: Oh, okay!

JAKE: Try to earn a little dough.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Wow. Earn a little scratch.

EMILY: [laughs] Ooh! Has he ever fished before? Is he just—

JAKE: No.

[all laugh]

JAKE: But Hardwon is: “I can do anything.”

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah, I bet you— I think, for you, fishing probably means, like, diving under the water and just grabbing a fish.

JAKE: Yeah.

EMILY: I mean, that’s definitely what it means for Moonshine.

CALDWELL: Right.

EMILY: For Moonshine, you make a little trap in the mud, and then the fish swim in.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Mhm.

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] Dope! A mud-fish!

MURPH: [crosstalk: laughs] Wait… fishing? For the…?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; southern drawl] So, a trap in the mud—

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah, well, at the bottom of—

MURPH: Oh, in the bottom! Okay.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; southern drawl] Yeah.

Advertisement

EMILY:[crosstalk] Yeah, in the bottom of The Crick there’s a lot of mud…

MURPH: Oh, right!

EMILY: [crosstalk] — you make little traps, fish swims into it, then you… [laughs]

MURPHY: [crosstalk] Sorry, I forgot that they were fishing in The Crick.

CALDWELL:[southern drawl] What you do is you get a milk jug, you tie a fishin’ line to it…

[Emily laughs]

 JAKE: [southern drawl] Well, maybe there’s not a lot of fish in The Crick anymore. Sumthin’s amiss at The Crick.

MURPH: [crosstalk; southern drawl] Right, sumthin’s amiss at The Crick. Sumthin’ ain’t right. Sumthin’ ain’t right in these here woods.

EMILY: [crosstalk; laughs] That is true, there’s not nearly as many fish as there should be. And the fish that are there? They’re swimmin’ the wrong way! [laughs]

 JAKE: [southern drawl; laughs] No!

CALDWELL: [laughs] I’m picturing that scene from Lord of the Rings where Legolas says, “Blood has been spilled this night,” but he just goes, [dramatic southern drawl] “Sumthin’ ain’t right.”

[all laugh] 

MURPH: [southern drawl] “Sumthin’ ain’t right in The Crick.” Alright, guys, let’s get into it!

CALDWELL: Nice!

EMILY: — and the skeeters! The skeeters are takin’ over The Crick! [laughs]

CALDWELL: [southern drawl] Aw, they’re big’uns too.

MURPH: EXT. MOONSTONE — NIGHT. I’m just kidding, I didn’t actually write that.

[all laugh]

MURPH: [crosstalk] Kind of epic, right? [laughs] Emily shut the fuck up and perked up.

JAKE: [crosstalk] I’ve never heard— yeah.

Advertisement

EMILY: [crosstalk] I was ready; I shut the fuck up! I was like, “Yes, daddy? Yes, daddy storyteller?”

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah!

[Jake laughs; ambient music plays]

MURPH: Okay, so… a man in a hooded cloak makes his way into Moonstone after traveling many miles off the main roads to the east. He had no trouble finding it, even at night; the glowing waters of the enchanted bay light up the entire village with a white-blue glow, like snow reflecting moonlight. A dirt path leads him past simple stone houses with thatched roofs, many of them covered in moss with purple and yellow and white flowers. It smells fresh, like a spring rain — which is not something one might expect from a fishing village, but clearly the influence of the druids is strong here.

He heads for the only building in the city that appears to have any life at this hour: The Hungry Trout Inn & Tavern. He enters to the sounds of an old bard playing a jaunty tune on the fiddle… Caldwell, can you give me a little fiddle sound?

[Caldwell makes obnoxious twangy fiddle noises; Murph & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Alright. There’s a fireplace on the far… alright — Caldwell, cut!

[Caldwell stops; all laugh]

JAKE: More fiddle, Caldwell! [laughs]

EMILY:[crosstalk] Oh, that is a good—

JAKE: [crosstalk] — and Emily, washboard!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah! Ooh, that should be my instrument! You know how I get to have…?

MURPH: [crosstalk] Oh! You can have a washboard. Write that down in your inventory that you have a washboard.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah. Great.

EMILY: I was gonna play — ‘cuz, as an Outlander, I get a musical instrument — I was gonna play a blade of grass. [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Two blades of— [laughs]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Washboard’s way better.

EMILY: [crosstalk] But, Murph, can I have a washboard and a blade of grass?

MURPH: You can have a washboard and a blade of grass, sure.

[Emily laughs]

Advertisement

JAKE: [crosstalk] Yes!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] …where are you going to find a blade of grass?

MURPH: So this cloaked man enters the tavern to the sounds of an old bard playing a jaunty tune on the fiddle. There’s a fire—

[Caldwell makes fiddle sounds; all laugh]

MURPH: No! I should’ve never asked for this!

[actual fiddle music plays]

MURPH: So there’s a fireplace on the far right side of the room, and lanterns with candles fill the tavern with a warm glow. Closest to him is a group of three fishermen sitting at a table, drinking ale and sharing a quiet conversation. Across the room, near the fire, is a group of four barbarians, drunk and rowdy.

Sitting at the bar is a single, young, twenty-something halfling boy — sitting by himself, nervously sipping his drink. The bartender is an older, half-orc woman — sturdy and serious. She bears a horrible burn scar across the entire left side of her body. The man; the traveler; the bastard of the mountain—

JAKE: Ooh!

MURPH: — takes off his hood, and removes his Goggles of the Night.

CALDWELL: [laughs] — wait…

MURPH: The strong-jawed, pensive face of Hardwon Surefoot surveys the scene.

CALDWELL: [laughs] I don’t like this; it makes it seem like he’s the main character!

JAKE: [laughs] That’s fine!

[all laugh]

JAKE: “Quiet, fiddle-player!”

MURPH: [laughs] What do you do? [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: I guess… I’m standing there, drinking in the beautiful sounds of the fiddle.

[all laugh; Caldwell makes fiddle sounds]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Homeless, by the way. Right? Homeless?

MURPH: [crosstalk; laughs] Jake’s first move playing D&D is drinking in the sounds of the fiddle!

[all laugh]

EMILY: I think you’re gonna be pretty good at this!

[all laugh again; Caldwell makes more fiddle sounds]

JAKE: [laughs] I let the fiddle wash over me.

MURPH: [laughs] — Hardwon just standing at the doorway, just, like, kinda tapping his toes! He’s just, like, listening to the fiddle! [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] He’s never heard music before!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Someone’s standing behind you, being like, “Sorry, can I just…? You’re just standing in the doorway… uh…”

CALDWELL: [laughs; imitating Hardwon] “Ah, this music!”

JAKE: [laughs] “God, your shoulders are so broad! I can’t get around you!”

EMILY: [crosstalk; laughs] “You’re just, like, a huge man, standing right in the doorway.”

CALDWELL: “If you could please just stand aside…”

JAKE: I’m gonna go over to this half-orc woman…

MURPH: Okay.

JAKE: — and order the biggest beer that they have.

MURPH: [laughs] You see, as you walk in— [laughs] …you order the biggest beer they have. 

[all laugh]

MURPH: This old half-orc woman just looks at you with disdain, and goes: [as Mishka; surly, gruff voice] We have one size.

[all laugh]

MURPH: I’ll just go get you an ale.

[all laugh again]

JAKE: — then I’ll have two!

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Classic.

MURPH: She nods, and you see her go back, and she fills up two ales…

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: — puts it down; you throw her a few copper. You see the little halfling guy sitting next to you sees that you get two ales, and he turns to you, and he says: [as Scoutmaster Denny; high-pitched, stammering, craven voice] Oh, hey, man… uh… [stumbles on words] What-what-what brings you to town? You seem… y-… y-you seem — uh-uh, er… right strong.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Is this Beverly?

MURPH: [laughs] No.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: It’s not Beverly?

MURPH: You don’t know who Beverly is!

JAKE: — of course, of course!

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Okay. I’m looking for work around these parts. You know… you know where I could get a fishing boat? [all laugh]

MURPH: Oh! Well, I’m— um… so I’m actually a scoutmaster. I’m actually not— [swallows nervously] I’m not a fisherman here. You see he’s like really fucking nervous.

[Murph & Jake laugh]

MURPH: He’s really super nervous, and he goes: Are you, like, a… by any chance, kind of, like, hero…? —or anything?

JAKE: [laughs] Yes, you have heard of me, haven’t you?

[all laugh]

JAKE: Finally! I’m Hardwon Surefoot: pride of the dwarphanage; the bastard of the mountain.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Um… and which, uh— which mountain would that be, sir?

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Uh… forget it.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Okay, well, um… [swallows nervously] Uh, see… so, I’m-I’m like a… a, uh…

JAKE: —a… a…?

MURPH: [increasingly faster, more nervous, craven, and higher-pitched] I’m like the head of, uh… [stumbles on words] Well, not the head of… I-I guess I’m not the chapter leader or anything; I’m just a scoutmaster, okay?

JAKE: [crosstalk] Okay.

MURPH: So I’m a scoutmaster, I’m part of this group called the Green Teens, right? So, I’m responsible for, like, some of the younger guys and stuff, some li-li-like, you know, like fourteen- or fifteen-year old halflings or something… I teach them how to, like, w-w-we-we, like, b-b-b-build fires, and… uh… and I-I, uh… I—

JAKE: [crosstalk] I see, yeah.

MURPH: — give them patches and things like that… So, anyway… um… we came to town, and we were supposed to— there were supposed to be some, like, druids here that were supposed to show us the bay, and they were supposed to show us, like, the… um… [smacks lips nervously] …uhhh, uh… the li- the, like, staff that-that’s… at the bottom, that’s like magic— that, uh, makes the fish come— but then the druid said that they were busy, so I said, “Okay, w-w-w-well I’ll-I’ll just take the kids out, uhhh… by myself,” s-so I took the kids out, and then some, um… some-some-some frogmen, uh… came out and they, uh, they-they took the kids — th-th-the-the Green Teens are gone!

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Yeah, I did notice that you didn’t have kids as you were telling me this story about how you were in charge of the kids…

[all laugh]

MURPH: [crosstalk] Yeah! Right, yeah!

JAKE: — and there aren’t any here.

MURPH: There’s-there’s-th-th—

JAKE: There’s no kids.

MURPH: — there’s no kids!

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Right.

MURPH: So, um… I actually, already, uh, paid… — uh, s-s-so my parents have a decent amount of money, so, uh, th-th-th-they gave— they gave me, um… some money—

JAKE: [crosstalk] — I need money!

MURPH: — to come with, and I-I gave… I-I-I gave those gentlemen over there, uh, twenty gold, uh… and, uh… You see that he points to the barbarians: these, like, big fucking hulking rowdy dudes, who are bald and have just, like, these ponytails popping out—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; laughs] Oh, that’s a good look.

MURPH: — and you see… — there’s four dudes there, and one of them’s sorta bigger than the other ones — you see him, like, let out this hearty laugh, and he’s missing a bunch of teeth. He’s like this fucked-up dude. So you see this scoutmaster guy, he says: I-I offered them, uh, tw-twenty gold, a-a-and th-th-they said they would go to th-th-th-th-the swamp and, uh… uh, get the teens back from the, uh, from… from the… from the frogmen, but, uh… they-they’re— they’re just sitting there, and anytime I ask them to… if they’re gonna go, they-they-they-they just y-yell at me a-a-a-a-and say that th-th-th-they’re getting ready and they need to get hydrated.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: I see.

MURPH: So, I need… I need— I need someone serious for this job.

JAKE: Yeah. So they’re using your gold to buy their beer right now.

MURPH: Correct, correct!

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: That is very much correct! My name’s Denny, by the way!

JAKE: Hey.

MURPH: Denny holds his hand out to shake.

JAKE: Hardwon. Surefoot. God, your hands are clammy.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Y-yes, I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m… just a little bit nervous. Okay, so, as you’re shaking this dude’s hand and drinking your two beers like a fucking weirdo…

[all laugh]

JAKE: I should’ve gotten one at a time; this one’s already warm.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Suddenly you hear hooves outside, as, like, a little carriage pulls up.

[Jake makes clip-clopping hoof noises]

MURPH: — and you hear a teen voice saying goodbye to the person in the carriage, and Beverly Toegold, the small halfling boy — also wearing a Green Teen uniform with braces — enters the tavern.

[all laugh]

MURPH: You can see your scoutmaster guy up at the bar, and you see these barbarians, and you see these fishermen, and you see a bard.

CALDWELL: Right. I’ve met this scoutmaster before?

MURPH: Yes, you’ve met Scoutmaster Denny.

CALDWELL: Okay, cool. Alright, I probably just run right over to him.

MURPH: Okay.

JAKE: [unintelligible crosstalk]

CALDWELL: I kind of, like, put blinders on and don’t look at anything else. I don’t make eye-contact with anyone, and I just beeline right for my scoutmaster.

MURPH:So Beverly makes a beeline for Scoutmaster Denny and Hardwon. Hardwon, you’ve already marched in, made yourself known, and you’re already just surrounded by fucking dorks.

[Jake & Emily laugh]

MURPH: So you see Scoutmaster Denny sees you right away, and he looks super nervous and ashamed—

CALDWELL: Dennyyyy!

MURPH: O-o-oh hey, little guy! Uh, uh, uh—

CALDWELL: It’s me! It’s Beverly!

MURPH: Beverly, uh… so good to see you again, hey—

CALDWELL: Remember? You taught me ropes.

MURPH: Yes, uh, so, um… Okay, uhhh… er, Green Teens is cancelled.

CALDWELL: W-what? Wait, no… what do you mean?

MURPH: It’s just, it’s just… It’s… It’s cancelled…

JAKE: He lost all the kids.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Ohh, my God…

CALDWELL: Wait… ah, ha-ha! Oh, this is — he also taught me my humor badge, so this is, like, clearly one of his classic—

MURPH: — just a classic Green Teen goof!

CALDWELL: Yeah, this is a Green Teen goof! We do these little goofs around campfires, and this is one of them — I’m sure of it. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Uh… I don’t think so. He wouldn’t’ve… he told me.

CALDWELL: I don’t know — but, like, look at his face! His face is so… he’s twisted his face into a mask of humour!

MURPH: You see he’s just furiously shaking his head at Hardwon, like “please don’t sell me out.”

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: I feel like Beverly sits on the other side. So — away from Hardwon, but adjacent to Denny.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: — and then he, still not believing that this is actually true, tries to get the attention of the half-orc bartender.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: ‘Scuse me, ma’am?

MURPH: What— yeah, what?

CALDWELL: Hi, do you have Sprite?

[beat]

MURPH: …no, we don’t have Sprite.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: Okay, just anything fizzy would be great.

MURPH: You see she just like pours you a…

JAKE: — a beer. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] She just pours you, like a cup of water…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Okay—

MURPH: — and then just like sticks her finger in and moves it around and blows some bubbles in it and just hands it to you.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Mmm, savoury. Thank you!

[Emily laughs again]

JAKE: [laughs] “Savoury…”

CALDWELL: I tip her very well.

[all laugh]

MURPH: [laughs] Excellent. Okay, you throw her some copper and a couple extra silver.

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: Suddenly, a possum bursts into the tavern and jumps up on the table with all the fishermen, and starts just, like, grabbing at their scraps and everything.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: PawPaw!

[Murph laughs]

EMILY: PawPaw! PawPaw, git!

MURPH: — and a beautiful elven woman — covered in fungus, wearing…

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: — are you wearing overalls?

EMILY: Overalls, yeah. And there’s mushrooms pouring out of the bib of my overall.

[all laugh]

EMILY: PawPaw!

MURPH: She rushes in after the possum, grabbing him.

EMILY: PawPaw! I’m so sorry, he must’ve smelled your food… PawPaw, git!

[all laugh]

EMILY: Git! You’re gonna git kicked!

[all laugh again]

MURPH: You see PawPaw climbs back up onto this Crick-elf’s shoulder.

EMILY: I am so sorry, if I can just… What table did we go on?

MURPH: The fishermen. The three fishermen sitting there.

EMILY: I am so sorry, y’all — if, just… you know what? Give me whatever you caught today, I’ll go back in the kitchen. I’ll whip you up some delicious… y’know, some delicious fish. I’m a great cook.

MURPH: You see one of the guys just looks at you and he says…

EMILY: [crosstalk] All I need’s a little…

MURPH: [as a fisherman; deep and gravely] Er… I’m sorry, do you work here? You’re just gonna go in the kitchen and cook something?

EMILY: Y’know, I found that it’s just easy to make friends!

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: If you’re just a sweetheart, you can walk back anywhere.

MURPH: You hear the half-orc woman, back from behind the bar, just yells: If you’re gonna bring a rodent in here…

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: — you can at least buy a drink.

EMILY: Oh! Okay! Yeah, I’ll definitely have a drink. I go over and I’m like: Yeah! Gimme, you know… how about, like, a hooch, or, like, a bathtub mead?

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: — or if you got some berries that gone bad, I can just suck on those.

[all laugh]

MURPH: [laughs] You see she just pours you an ale and just hands it to you

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, okay!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] I turn to Denny and say: [whispering] Is that our guide?

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Um… No, I’m… I’m your guide.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: [whispering] No, for the tour.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Oh, for the… the druids, right.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] — of the trident, yeah.

MURPH: No, that’s cancelled. That is fully cancelled.

CALDWELL: Okay, this joke is going on a long time. Can you, like, wrap it up? What’s the punchline of the joke, Scoutmaster Denny?

MURPH: Okay, you know what? This is… This is a… learning… experience…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh.

MURPH: [crosstalk] — is what this is, uh, because, uh… as Halflings… of the Light…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yes!

MURPH: — as Campers of the Light… we need to be honest!

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: We should always be honest, and so I will tell you, young Beverly—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yes?

JAKE: [crosstalk] There you go.

MURPH: — that I lost the Green Teens! They were captured by frogmen, and dragged into the swamp!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] What? Oh, my God…

JAKE: [crosstalk] I told you.

EMILY: Sorry, excuse me, miss half-orc — what’s your name?

MURPH: [sighs] My name’s Mishka.

EMILY: Mishka. That’s a beautiful name, God bless your mother. Do you have a saucer of Crick-water for my possum? [laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] I have some water in my canteen!

EMILY: Oh, hi!

CALDWELL: Hi!

EMILY: That’d be great — because PawPaw, he is parched.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Okay.

JAKE: [crosstalk; imitating Moonshine] “Parched.”

EMILY: [crosstalk] I can tell.

MURPH: Hardwon, you are just surrounded by fucking rejects right now.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah— parched PawPaw.

[Caldwell laughs]

 JAKE: This is not what I expected from my epic journey.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: I do give her some water from my canteen. I hand her my canteen.

MURPH: Great.

EMILY: [gasps] Thank you so— okay!

CALDWELL: — and then, as soon as I hand it—

MURPH: PawPaw starts furiously lapping it up, like getting a mess everywhere—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Ohh…

JAKE: [crosstalk] God.

MURPH: Hardwon, you’re just, like, covered in water.

EMILY: I hold the canteen under my armpit so it looks like he’s suckling from my breast. [laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Huh. You know what? You can just keep that canteen, actually. Thank you.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: So, wai— you’re serious? You’re speaking in the Light of Truth about this matter, Denny?

MURPH: I-I’m-I’m dead-… I’m dead-seriously speaking in the Light of Truth. The… uh…

CALDWELL: Oh, my God…

MURPH: — the Green Teens are gone.

CALDWELL: They’re all— they’re gone? What are we gonna do?

JAKE: Well, that’s not all; he was also robbed.

MURPH: Yes!

JAKE: [unintelligible crosstalk]

CALDWELL: You were…?

MURPH: Um… okay, so these fine gentlemen, uh, behind us… and then you hear the bigger dude yells out:[as a drunken, stupid barbarian] ‘EY, GET US ANOTHER ROUND!and Denny turns around, and says: Well, surely the twenty gold I paid you before will be plenty for another— I SAID WE WANT ANOTHER ROUND!…yes, sir!

[all laugh]

MURPH: You see he orders another round from Mishka, and a waiter picks them all up and carries them over and puts them down, and then he comes back, and he turns to you, and he says:

JAKE: [crosstalk] God, Beverly, that’s your leader?

MURPH: Yeah, so I was robbed.

CALDWELL: Scoutmaster, those men are taking advantage of you! We can’t let that happen; that’s unjust!

MURPH: [voice squeaking] Uh… okay. Here’s the thing, though— is that there’s a lot of them in town and, uh… they also, uh, chased out the mayor, and… they’re living in the mayor’s house, so things are really friggin’ bad here, man.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay.

MURPH: Nobody told me this when I got here — I just wanted to show some Green Teens the friggin’ trident at the bottom of the bay… [breathes heavily]

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Does this mean the Jamboreen’s cancelled too?

MURPH: The Jamboreen is SUPER-cancelled, Beverly.

[all laugh]

MURPH: I can’t express properly how much the Jamboreen is cancelled.

CALDWELL: Aw, geez!

EMILY: Jamboreen?

CALDWELL: Yeah, a J—

EMILY: I love a good Jamboreen!

CALDWELL: Who doesn’t?

MURPH: [crosstalk] Okay, wait—

EMILY: That’s when everyone takes their shoes off and rolls around in the mud![laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] No one’s focused on the missing children.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Right, yes, okay — so there are missing children! You know what? Um, uhhh… okay, uhhh…

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, I’m sorry, I don’t know what’s going on.

MURPH: So, Beverly, um… you wanna be a six-leaf Green Teen, right?

CALDWELL: More than anything!

MURPH: Okay, um… if you go get the Green Teens back…— This is your test! This is your test! If you do it, you’re… y-y-y-you’re a junior Green Knight!

CALDWELL: [gasps] I knew this moment would come! You know that this is why they keep the six-leaf trials under such tight scrutiny.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Yep!

CALDWELL: — so that you can’t guess what you’re gonna have to do for your final test!

MURPH: [crosstalk] — just all-all-all a part of the plan!

CALDWELL: Oh, my gosh!

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh, God. [laughs]

CALDWELL: Okay, so all I have to do is get the gold back from those ruffians over there…

MURPH: — nope! Don’t talk to them!

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Don’t get the gold back from them!

CALDWELL: What do you—

MURPH: That’s just a loss! Let’s just chalk that one up to a loss!

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: Alright, okay.

JAKE: [imitating Scoutmaster Denny] “That gold is GOOONE!”

MURPH: That gold is GOOONE, man!

CALDWELL: But that’s your gold by right! They stole it from you!

MURPH: Cool, yeah, that’s gold— there’s like kids, d— the kids are def— th-they’re gonna get— I don’t know if you know anything about bullywugs — the frogmen — but they’re gonna— they’re gonna ritualistically sacrifice them!

EMILY: Oh, I’m so sorry, PawPaw drank too quickly and he spit up on the floor.

MURPH: Uh… [laughs]

CALDWELL: Oh, boy…

EMILY: Do you have a rag behind the bar that I can just clean up this— [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh… you spit up all over my foot.

CALDWELL: Scoutmaster, you yourself taught me: “Careful where you stomp; bullywugs hide in the swamp,” so that’s probably where we should start!

MURPH: [swallows nervously] Yep… yeah, you guys should—

EMILY: Ah, bullywugs!

MURPH: Okay, um…

EMILY: We got ‘em down by The Crick!

EMILY: ‘Course!

CALDWELL: I do too; I have a Bullywug Identification Patch, that I got—

[Murph laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, okay!

MURPH: [laughs] Beverly once picked a bullywug out of a line-up and he got a patch.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah, okay.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Well, I dissected it. I dissected a dead one.

MURPH: [laughs] Oh, okay.

EMILY: I used to rassle with them, so…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Oh, okay!

EMILY: Down at The Crick, y’know, it’s a fun little thing: you just kind of rassle a bullywug.

CALDWELL: They’re very aggressive; you must be strong!

EMILY: Yeah, I’m pretty strong.

CALDWELL: Wow.

MURPH: Oh, well, i-i-if you’re strong, um, maybe, uh.. uh… Beverly, could you turn around for a split second?

CALDWELL: Sure, absolutely.

MURPH: Okay, great. [laughs] So Beverly just turns around and is just staring there.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: I’m smiling.

MURPH: Yeah.

CALDWELL: I sing a campfire song.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Hardwon starts tapping his foot.

MURPH: So you guys gotta make sure that this kid doesn’t die. Um… but, he’s actually pretty strong, okay? He’s gonna be a good Green Knight, so he’ll be pretty helpful to you guys. Uh… but, you guys— I can offer you guys some gold. If you guys keep an eye on this guy and go get the Green Teens back, I’ll give you guys… twenty gold each?

EMILY: What if instead of gold, you just gave me some sort of… I don’t know, I’ve personally got a— sort of, like, a mushroom library/spore library, collecting as many strains as I can. If you could just pay me in mushrooms…

MURPH: I just have like— yeah! I have like, gift bags for the Boy Scouts! I can just give you some, like, mushrooms.

JAKE: I’ll take the gold.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Okay, yeah, I’ll just give you forty gold then.

JAKE: Dope.

EMILY: Okay, so, I’m just gonna write down “Green Teen Gift Bag”…?

MURPH: Yeah.

EMILY: Okay.

MURPH: Here you go! I was supposed to give this to the kids at the end of the night, but… looks like I won’t be needing ‘em!

CALDWELL: Oh! So these are, like, honorary scoutmasters?

MURPH: They’re honorary scoutmasters, I deemed them myself. Here you go!

CALDWELL: Oh, wow!

MURPH: And you see he rips off two patches. This dude is just so scared and in over his head. He just rips off two patches and just like shoves them on your guys’ chests.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Wow!

EMILY: [laughs] Ooh, okay! I hock up a loogie and use it to stick the patch to my overalls.

MURPH: [laughs] Ah, and it weirdly sticks. It weirdly sticks.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Ma’am, your possum is shitting under the bar.

EMILY: [laughs] PawPaw! What’d I tell you about goin’ bucket in public?

JAKE: [possum noises]

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Don’t worry—

MURPH: The possum’s going nuts. You see Mishka the half-orc just fucking sweeps him away, and he gets knocked on the ground, and he just starts scrambling on the ground.

EMILY: [laughs] PawPaw, I’m gunna put you on your leash! PawPaw, you’re dangerously close!

JAKE: [laughs; crosstalk] He’s just a wild animal.

[all laugh]

MURPH: As you go to place it on the table of the barbarians, they’re in the middle of this rowdy laugh. The guy picks up the note, and then he grabs you — and he laughs again; he goes: I like you, you’re funny.

CALDWELL: [laughs] I do have my Humor Patch, yes.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: I tell you what.

CALDWELL: Yeah?

MURPH: You go get us another round of ale and I won’t kill you.

CALDWELL: Okay, well I don’t have… I’m not of age, so I don’t think I could technically do that. Would you like some Sprite?

EMILY: I take out a flask and I say: Y’all ever had bathtub mead?

CALDWELL: Would that be good? My scoutmaster has some bathtub mead if you want that.

MURPH: Listen, kid. I’m gonna fuckin’ kill you if you don’t go get me an ale right now.

CALDWELL: Okay, could an adult please get them some mead?

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here… [unintelligible crosstalk]—

EMILY: [crosstalk] Okay, but hear me out—

MURPH: Beverly turns to Hardwon.

JAKE: Christ.

EMILY: — hear me out, mister barbarian. If you’ve never had bathtub mead, what we do is we take a bit of raccoon urine, we ferment it under the moonlight for ‘bout three months, and it will get you fucked up.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Please don’t curse.

MURPH: You go get me some ale, and then I won’t kill this little one.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay.

EMILY: Hmm… I don’t feel like this is very hospitable. Is this your town? We’re coming into your town and you’re showing us a real mean cheek.

CALDWELL: I feel like while she’s doing that I do go over to Hardwon and give him some coin to buy the ale.

JAKE: I’m not buying these guys… [laughs] —fucking beer, man.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Beverly and Hardwon are just having a quiet moment, and you see Scoutmaster Denny turns around from the bar and he’s like: Hu-huh, uh, what are you guys doing? Uh…

CALDWELL: Do you think we should get them wine instead?

MURPH: No, okay!

MURPH: But you see Scoutmaster Denny just runs over with more ales and he’s like: Uh, no need to go after the little guy, gentlemen! I’ve got… Everybody’s drinking on me tonight! — and this big barbarian dude goes: No. I want him to do it.

MURPH: Great?

CALDWELL: What? [laughs]

EMILY: — which means that I channel the power of spores and mushrooms and become one with my spores.

MURPH: For anyone who plays D&D at home listening to this insane thing that Emily is saying, this is a Circle of Spores Druid. It’s an Unearthed Arcana thing that was just introduced. So you’re turning into a mushroom woman right now, essentially.

EMILY: I’m basically turning into, almost like Poison Ivy.

CALDWELL: You’re starting with your limit break. [laughs] I love it.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh, hell yeah.

EMILY: Yeah — and that does take a Wild Shape action. Does Wild Shape take an entire turn?

MURPH: Yes, that takes an action.

EMILY: Okay, so I just kind of stand in the corner and rub mushrooms on myself.

[all laugh] 

JAKE: [laughs] Hardwon is very confused.

CALDWELL: I have to imagine that the barbarians that were huffing that sauce are also very confused.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] The barbarians that were huffing the sauce look at this woman that just starts sprouting mushrooms, and they are tripping balls.

JAKE: [imitating barbarians] “What was in that, that, that, that… mead?”

CALDWELL: [imitating barbarians] “Must be the raccoon piss.”

MURPH: And that’s you, Hardwon. Although, wait. Do you get to, on your turn, do your shooting spores thing?

EMILY: Oh yeah, I can, ‘cuz that’s a reaction! So that wouldn’t take a whole action.

CALDWELL: Oh!

MURPH: Yeah, so you get to launch your spores if you want.

EMILY: Okay, but because I’m in Symbiotic Entity mode, that would mean that they deal double damage.

MURPH: Great, then go ahead and roll your damage.

EMILY: I think Halo is just three poison—

MURPH: “Use your reaction on your turn to deal three poison damage to one creature you can see within ten feet of you.

EMILY: Yeah, so now I’m doing six damage. So six poison damage at the main dude.

MURPH: Six poison damage at the main dude.

EMILY: So I rub mushrooms on myself, and then from my hand a mushroom is born.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: — and I blow it at him, like I’m blowing a kiss.

MURPH: [laughs] This crazy fucking mushroom woman blows spores in this dude’s eyes. He just goes: Argh! Argh! He’s so fucking pissed off.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Hardwon, you’re up.

JAKE: I’m punching the serious dude right in the nose.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Hell yeah.

MURPH: Wait, you’re not going axe, you’re going fist?

JAKE: Oh shit, it’s coming to death blows now, already?

MURPH: These guys are definitely gonna try to kill you. They’re going for their swords.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Alright, fucking greataxe from behind the head. Hardwon wields it one-handed.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah!

MURPH: Go ahead, roll your d20 to see if you hit.

JAKE: [rolls die] Twelve plus four. Sixteen.

MURPH: That hits! 

EMILY: Yeah!

MURPH: Roll your damage. It’s a d12 plus whatever your modifier is.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Because barbarians usually have pretty low armor right?

CALDWELL: Oh yeah, you gotta roll damage now.

MURPH: You gotta roll damage, baby.

JAKE: Wait, how do I do that?

EMILY: You roll a d12. Yeah, that one.

[Jake rolls die]

CALDWELL: That d-twilly. Ten!

EMILY: Oh, baby!

JAKE: Ten, wait— plus…

MURPH: Ten plus four. So fourteen.

JAKE: Fourteen.

MURPH: [laughs] So, this dude gets blinded by spores… 

[Caldwell and Emily laugh]

MURPH: — and then Hardwon just slashes him across the chest with his axe, and he lets out this roar; he’s so fucking angry. What was it, fourteen damage?

EMILY: Yeah.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: Okay, this dude is still standing. He’s a pretty tough dude.

CALDWELL: Alright.

MURPH: So now, it is—

CALDWELL: It’s four total barbarians?

MURPH: Four total barbarians, yes. One real tough-looking dude, and three guys that are a little bit scrawnier. And two of them are super stoned.

[all laugh]

MURPH: I’ll give them disadvantage when they attack.

CALDWELL: Nice!

EMILY: [crosstalk] That’s my mead!

MURPH: So this main guy is going to go ahead and rear up with his greataxe. He’s gonna take a Reckless Attack, so with advantage against Hardwon. So he swings his axe right back at Hardwon.

EMILY: [whistles] Whoa.

MURPH: [rolls die] And he is definitely gonna hit.

JAKE: Oh, no.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: So he hits Hardwon. [rolls die] He slashes Hardwon across his mighty shoulder for twelve damage.

CALDWELL: [gasps] Whoa!

MURPH: So go ahead and mark down that damage.

CALDWELL: Wait, does he not have to roll AC?

MURPH: He did! Yeah, he beat it. [laughs]

CALDWELL: Oh, okay — I missed it. My bad. Edit that.

MURPH: So now—

JAKE: So twelve, that’s minus from my…

Advertisement
MURPH: — that’s minus from your maximum hit points. So what are your maximum hit points? Like, twenty-two?

JAKE: Twenty-two.

MURPH: Okay, so you’re at…

JAKE: Ten.

MURPH: Okay. So now these warrior guys are gonna go. First, the sober guy is gonna take a swing at Moonshine.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Bring it on, bitch. I’m a Symbiotic Entity, I’ve got plus-three to my hit points.

MURPH: [rolls die] — and he misses big time. He whiffs with his spear.

EMILY: Oh, my God — I use my—

MURPH: He swings his spear, misses.

EMILY: The mushrooms come to my aid. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Yeah, it just gets caught by a mushroom like it’s a fucking hand in a kung-fu movie.

CALDWELL: It’s like one of those big flat ones you see on trees.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: These other two tribal guys who are a little bit stoned are also gonna swing at this fucking mushroom monster that they see. [rolls die] This guy whiffs big time, and this other guy… [rolls die] — oh, he’s gonna hit. So even though he’s stoned he’s just screaming and swinging at anything.[rolls die] And he’s gonna go ahead and hit Moonshine for eight damage.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Ooh. 

EMILY: Terrible hospitality! Not how I would treat people coming to my town.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Not very polite at all.

MURPH: Now it is Beverly’s turn.

CALDWELL: Alright! So, I think Beverly probably flew all the way back and landed behind the bar, and he’s kinda gathering himself amidst bottles and barrels — and he picks up a bottle and says: Hey, you did have Sprite!

Advertisement
[all laugh]

CALDWELL: [laughs] That’s okay, though! I think now Beverly turns to Denny and says: Scoutmaster, sir! Permission to defend myself?

MURPH: Yep, kill them! Please kill them!

JAKE: [laughs; imitating Scoutmaster Denny] “And hurry!”

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Thank you, sir! So I’m going to unsheathe my sword.

MURPH: Great.

CALDWELL: And I want to… I guess I’ll just attack the main guy as well. I don’t want to do anything fancy yet.

MURPH: Okay. Are you going to do any kind of Smite damage, or anything like that?

CALDWELL: You know what? Let’s start this thing off with a bang, yeah. I will cast…

JAKE: Smite his ass, dude.

MURPH: You have a special ability that just does 2d8 damage, right?

CALDWELL: Yes. Yeah, I’m gonna use that.

MURPH: Okay. You could also see if you hit and then try to do Divine Smite.

CALDWELL: Yes, that’s what I’m gonna do.

MURPH: So go ahead, take a swing.

CALDWELL: Okay. Just roll a d20?

MURPH: Roll a d20.

CALDWELL: Okay, here we go. [rolls die] That’s a nineteen — what do I add to that?

MURPH: Oh, dude — you fucking hit.

CALDWELL: Nice! Okay, cool, so—

MURPH: Go ahead and roll 2d8 plus your normal damage.

CALDWELL: 2d8, uh — wait…

Advertisement
MURPH: [laughs] So Beverly, after this polite little boy gets pushed over and falls behind the bar, asks for permission

[Caldwell and Emily laugh]

MURPH: —and then yells out to his god, Pelor, the God of Light, and this burst of radiant energy comes out as he slashes this dude so hard.

CALDWELL: Is this the d8, uh…?

MURPH: It should have eight sides on it.

JAKE: That’s how you know.

[Emily laughs

MURPH: So roll that twice, and then roll your damage.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] Okay, so that’s a two… [rolls die] — and a seven. So that’s nine—

MURPH: And then another d8.

CALDWELL: Another d8, okay.

MURPH: Yeah, just your normal longsword damage.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] So that’s a three.

MURPH: So twelve. So seventeen damage.

CALDWELL: Then plus five, right?

MURPH: I added that.

CALDWELL: Okay, cool.

EMILY: Damn, bitch!

MURPH: So seventeen damage.

EMILY: Damn!

MURPH: This guy’s starting to look a little fucked up.

JAKE: This little guy—

EMILY: Moonshine turns around and she’s like: What!?

[Caldwell laughs; breathes heavily]

Advertisement
MURPH: This burst of radiant energy comes out of Beverly’s longsword as he slashes the guy again across the chest — and he grabs his chest and you see a little bit of blood dribbles out of his mouth.

CALDWELL: That’s what you get for being rude!

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Blood falls on the “you guys were rude” piece of paper.

[Caldwell and Emily laugh]

MURPH: Scoutmaster Denny meekly walks over to Hardwon and he’s gonna Lay on Hands him because he’s a Paladin, and you’re back up to full health.

JAKE: Appreciate that, brother. Really needed it.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Sweet, good. Good, good.

MURPH: [rolls die] Scoutmaster Denny Lays Hands you for twelve. Then let’s bring it back up to Moonshine.

EMILY: Okay. Now I’m gonna make a melee attack with my scimitar, which is covered in fungus, at that main bad guy.

MURPH: Cool.

EMILY: Actually, fuck it! I’m gonna go after— No, we should get rid of that main bad guy. Yeah, after that main bad guy.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Yeah, let’s kill that main guy. They might break after that, you know.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah. 

EMILY: [rolls die] And definitely not gonna to hit. That’s gonna be seven.

MURPH: That does not hit.

EMILY: Okay, well I’m still going to—

MURPH: You could still shoot your spores.

EMILY: Halo of Spores, blow it like a kiss.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: You blow it like a kiss.

EMILY: Blow it like a kiss, and I wink at him after I do it.

Advertisement
MURPH: Oh, you’re a nightmare.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: So six more poison damage.

MURPH: Six more poison damage to this dude.

EMILY: And then I’m going to use a bonus action to heal myself with Healing Word.

MURPH: Great. So what is that, a d8? d4…

EMILY: [rolls die] d4 plus five.So six.

CALDWELL: How do bonus actions work?

MURPH: A bonus action you can take after your action.

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: So you probably don’t have many things you can do as bonus actions.

CALDWELL: Oh, okay — it will say ‘bonus action’—

MURPH: It will say—

EMILY: It will say.

CALDWELL: Nice. Okay, cool.

MURPH: So that takes us to Hardwon.

JAKE: Dude, alright. Let’s do it.

MURPH: Just slashing at this guy?

JAKE: Oh, yeah, that’s what I’m doing! [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] That’s what you do.

JAKE: Axe coming back around, going right at his chest again. [rolls die] 

CALDWELL: [laughs] Ooh! Sixteen.

MURPH: Dope. That definitely hits.

EMILY: Yeah, bitch! 

JAKE: Sixteen, plus… twenty.

MURPH: Yeah, whatever your modifier, it hits already. Roll that d12, baby!

CALDWELL: Roll that beautiful dice.

[Jake rolls a die]

EMILY: Ooh! 

JAKE: Seven, plus…

EMILY: — plus four, or five.

JAKE: Four — eleven.

MURPH: Eleven damage, damn. Okay, this dude is looking seriously fucked up.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: He’s not done yet?

MURPH: No. [laughs] He’s a fucking tough guy.

JAKE: He’s a barbarian, dude.

EMILY: Bev, you’ve gotta take him out!

CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay, here we go.

EMILY: Bev, it’s up to you!

MURPH: Okay, so that takes us to this dude—

JAKE: [laughs] Only you can save us, Beverly! [laughs]

EMILY: Bev! [laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] That’s a lot of pressure.

EMILY: You are our only hope, Beverly! [laughs]

MURPH: Oh, shit! This dude took a Reckless Attack, so this guy should be at disadvantage.

CALDWELL: Ah.

MURPH: So go ahead and roll again, Moonshine, to see if you hit, since you missed on your first attack.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, to see if I hit? [rolls die]  

CALDWELL: Fifteen.

EMILY: Fifteen plus four: nineteen.

MURPH: That’s definitely gonna hit, so roll your damage.

EMILY: Woo! And that’s gonna be damage plus poison damage.

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: So that’s gonna be… [rolls die] — five plus two. Seven, plus… [rolls die] — five, so twelve.

MURPH: Damn.

EMILY: Oh wait— oh, no, no. Yes, twelve.

MURPH: Okay. This dude is seriously, seriously, seriously fucked up. On his last legs of—

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] You’re damn right.

EMILY: So she had taken him for twelve plus six.

MURPH: Right, okay.

EMILY: Damn, he’s strong. He’s still standing?

MURPH: So this dude is seriously fucked up. With his last inch of life he tries to take off Hardwon’s head.

[all laugh]

JAKE: The guy that started it all.

MURPH: [rolls die] He is going to hit.

JAKE: Oh, no.

CALDWELL: Oh, shit. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Yes, the man whose pride got us into this fight.

JAKE: [laughs] The pride of the mountain.

[Emily laughs]  

MURPH: The pride of the mountain—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] He topples—

MURPH: [rolls die] — nine damage to the pride of the mountain.

CALDWELL: You can handle that.

JAKE: Alright. I’ve survived worse. Just one moment ago.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: The other guys are gonna keep swinging at Moonshine here.

CALDWELL: Alright.

EMILY: Bring it on, bitch!

MURPH: [rolls die] The one guy is probably gonna hit. That is a seventeen to hit?

EMILY: Mmm, yeah — that’s definitely gonna hit.

MURPH: [rolls die] Okay, that’s gonna be five damage. Five damage from the first one. 

EMILY: Moonshine takes it, but she doesn’t even blink when it happens.

MURPH: Wow.

JAKE: That’s cool.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Just looks at him like a—

EMILY: She doesn’t even blink. She looks at her hand full of mushrooms and is like: You next.

JAKE: Hardwon’s, like, about to cry from his wounds, and then he looks at her like: Oh, yeah. I’m fine.

CALDWELL: Do the mushrooms have little humanistic characteristics? Do they have little faces on them?

EMILY: I mean, I see faces when I look at them. [laughs]

CALDWELL: Okay. [laughs]

EMILY: But I also eat them, so…

CALDWELL: [high, nasally voice] “Hi, Moonshine! We’re your babies!”

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: So these two stoned guys are gonna take swings at Moonshine. [rolls dice] Oh, he rolled a one and a nineteen. He’s at disadvantage, he’ll take the one so he misses. [rolls dice] The other guy rolls, and he’s gonna hit even though he’s at disadvantage. [rolls die] — and he hits you for seven damage.

CALDWELL: Beverly is unscathed, by the way.

MURPH: How you doing, Moonshine?

EMILY: Moonshine’s at eleven.

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: — because she got extra hit points for being Symbiotic Entity. And she also healed herself.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] So you’re at eleven— Okay.

JAKE: [crosstalk] I’m at thirteen now.

MURPH: Didn’t she get hit by the first guy? Okay. You have like twenty-five health?

EMILY: No, sorry, what did you hit me for? I thought you hit me for five this time.

MURPH: No, I hit you for five the first time, and I hit you for seven the second time. So for twelve total — so you’re at three.

EMILY: Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you the second time.

CALDWELL: You’re at three?

EMILY: No — I’m at four, thank you.

MURPH: You’re at four, okay. So Moonshine looks right fucked up. Back up to—

JAKE: Beverly!

CALDWELL: Is it me?

MURPH: No, actually it is… Yes, Beverly.

EMILY: I have to heal myself!

CALDWELL: Cool. I was planning on attacking the main guy. But now that I see that Moonshine—

EMILY: No, I look at you and I’m like: Don’t worry about me.

CALDWELL: Yeah, I feel like I go to Lay Hands on her — and then you say… what do you say?

EMILY: I say: Don’t worry. This hen’s taken care of. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [imitating Moonshine] “I Lay Hands on myself.”

CALDWELL: Yes, ma’am. Full disclosure; full honesty in the Light of Truth, I did not want to touch you.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Alright, so then I turn away from Moonshine and I turn to face the main barbarian. I say: Sir, I’ve given you every chance to back down, but unfortunately, as a Green Teen, I cannot let your reign of terror on this village to proceed.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Hit him with the sword! [laughs]

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: I will now recite the Green Teen’s Creed!

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Kill him, for the love of God!

CALDWELL: I hold my sword aloft — it glows ever so slightly — and I say: A Teen of Green is never mean. Our souls sublime, our hearts pristine. And at all times, we stay serene. To glean the sheen of a light unseen!

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: Alright, kid, I was being nice. You gotta do something.

[Jake & Murph laugh]

EMILY: You gotta do something. You don’t need to Lay Hands on me, but—

CALDWELL: — and after that, I kind of just recklessly launch myself at him with my sword drawn. [battle cry]

MURPH: [laughs] Alright. Go ahead and roll with advantage because he took a Reckless Attack.

CALDWELL: Alright, cool. [rolls die] That’s an eighteen.

MURPH: That’s gonna hit already.

CALDWELL: Alright!

EMILY: Roll to see if—

MURPH: You can roll to see if you Crit; if you want to roll again, see if you get a twenty.

CALDWELL: Okay, good call. [rolls die] That’s another eighteen.

MURPH: Okay, dope! You guys got some good rolls so far.

EMILY: Don’t jinx us.

CALDWELL: Alright, a d8. [rolls die] That’s a three — plus five, I guess?

MURPH: Eight, okay. So you see, after reciting the [laughs] Green Teen Creed—

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Uh-huh?

MURPH: Beverly launches forward and decapitates this dude.

[all laugh and cheer]

EMILY: Yeah!

JAKE: Oh-ho!

MURPH: Blood sprays fucking everywhere as his head flies over the bar. You see the other dudes look, like, mad scared.

EMILY: That little spring chicken’s got some talent.

MURPH: Oh, that’s actually Scoutmaster Denny. Who is going to…

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: He’ll cast Cure Wounds on Moonshine.

EMILY: Oh, thank you.

MURPH: [rolls die] Oh wow, he rolled pretty well. Ten. Ten HP back.

EMILY: Ooh!

MURPH: That takes us to Moonshine.

EMILY: Moonshine looks at him, and is like: Thank you.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Don’t come too close though, I’m very fertile.

MURPH: You’re welcome, miss!

EMILY: I’m very fertile.

JAKE: Too fertile.

EMILY: Be careful when you Lay Hands on me.

CALDWELL: What does that mean?

EMILY: [laughs] And then she—

MURPH: We’re not allowed to have sex, it’s okay.

EMILY: [laughs] As she looks at one of the guys that hit her… The guy that she said, “you next.”

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: Then she takes out her scimitar, aims it at him… [rolls die] — for twenty-two.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: That hits.

EMILY: Alright, so that’s gonna be—

MURPH: So roll your scimitar damage, and then it does poison damage too, right?

EMILY: [rolls die] It’s gonna be only three for the scimitar damage — [rolls die] — only one… four with the poison damage. Total of four. But then she’s gonna blow her kiss of poison.

MURPH: Okay.

JAKE: Shroom kiss.

EMILY: Her shroom kiss, she’s gonna blow it.

MURPH: For six damage?

EMILY: So ten total.

MURPH: This dude’s on fucking death’s door. These guys are much weaker.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Yeah, bitch.

MURPH: Hardwon, you’re up.

JAKE: Hell yeah. I’m swinging the axe at this dude’s dome.

MURPH: At the dude who’s weak?

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Oh, yeah. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Hardwon’s [unintelligible crosstalk]—

JAKE: [crosstalk] I want to decapitate somebody, too!

EMILY: [laughs] Hardwon feels, like, inferior.

CALDWELL: Axe to dome.

JAKE: [rolls die] That’s a six, though.

MURPH: Plus what?

EMILY: But you add…

JAKE: Six plus four. Ten.

MURPH: No, it’s… Oh, ten total? It’s not plus four, you have a higher thing than that.

CALDWELL: What do you add to your attack roll?

MURPH: You add your attack bonus.

JAKE: Oh, attack bonus? Where’s that?

MURPH: Your attack bonus is plus-six. So you got a twelve. So that does hit.

EMILY: So you got a twelve! [laughs]

MURPH: So that does hit.

JAKE: You’re damn right.

MURPH: So roll your damage.

EMILY: Yeah!

JAKE: [rolls die] Eight! That’s plus four.

CALDWELL: Ah!

MURPH: Twelve?

EMILY: Twelve.

MURPH: Dope, twelve damage. So Hardwon then decapitates this dude.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Yeah!

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: The head doesn’t go as far as Beverly’s head. 

[all laugh]

JAKE: Hardwon looks ashamed.

MURPH:— but it goes pretty far.

EMILY: Moonshine turns to the party and she’s like: Will you save the last one for me? Because now I feel like I gotta decapitate someone.

CALDWELL: [laughs] I feel like that’s probably—

JAKE: [laughs] Hardwon takes a step back.

CALDWELL: I only need to decapitate one head to get my Self-Defense Merit Badge, so I’m good. I don’t—

[all laugh]

JAKE: You’re furiously sewing a decapitated head badge onto your pack.
[all laugh]

MURPH: So you see these other two barbarians look at each other, super-scared, and they’re gonna disengage and start running out of the tavern.

CALDWELL: Mhm.

EMILY: And then I say: These people were real inhospitable. What do you say we chase them?

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Oh, shit!

MURPH: Are you guys, like, chasing them out the door?

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: I’ll chase them outside.

CALDWELL: I think—

EMILY: They’re definitely gonna run back to a crew of barbarians. So we would need to—

JAKE: We gotta find the kids.

EMILY: Yeah, that’s true.

CALDWELL: Yeah, we’ve been tasked with a mission.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Maybe we let them run.

JAKE: [crosstalk] We start to chase them, but we—

MURPH: They’re just outside the tavern. Are you guys chasing them out the tavern?

EMILY: There’s more barbarians outside the tavern?

MURPH: You don’t see if there are more yet.

EMILY: Here’s the only thought: if they run to their barbarian friends, we could be in bad standing by the time that we come back. We gotta silence these guys.

JAKE: [crosstalk] That’s true. We gotta kill these guys before they tell all the barbarians about us.

MURPH: Okay, so you guys run out and chase them just outside of the tavern. I’m gonna roll to see if there’s any other barbarians out there.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Oh!

JAKE: Oh, yes.

MURPH: [rolls die] I rolled a one. There are definitely no barbarians out there.
[all laugh]

JAKE: [crosstalk] It’s a nice, dark, quiet night.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; unintelligible] — barbarians!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Woo, yeah, baby!

MURPH: Not such a good roll for the DM. So Moonshine, you’re up.

EMILY: [rolls die] That’s gonna be sixteen.

MURPH: That hits.

EMILY: And…  [rolls die] — seven to hit, total.

MURPH: Great.

EMILY: And then… [rolls die; whistles] — another six.

MURPH: Another six, wow. You kill this dude.

EMILY: Woo!

MURPH: She fuckin’ slashes this— spit some fucking poison spores at him, and his head just explodes as it rapidly grows mushrooms.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Wait, wait, wait… can I — [laughs] Oh shit, even though he’s dead— so his head explodes? God dammit, I wanted to decapitate him.

CALDWELL: Three headshots. [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] You can decapitate him if you want. You tell me how you want to kill him.

EMILY: Well, I want to kill him with the spores, but then I’m gonna decapitate his lifeless body just so I can be part of the—

JAKE: [laughs] — sort of a “me too”!

MURPH: [laughs] Oh, my God! This woman is just fucking hacking him up.

EMILY: [laughs] As I’m doing it, I look up…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] I think that’s technically…

EMILY: — Hey, we got a club going!

JAKE: [laughs] Hardwon almost throws up.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: That takes us to—

CALDWELL: I take no pride in this.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: These are not the friends I wanted to make on my journey.

MURPH: Hardwon, go ahead. Wait, Beverly, have you gone? We may have skipped you.

CALDWELL: Well, I was…

MURPH: The last thing you did was behead somebody?

CALDWELL: Yes.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Yeah, I beheaded someone since him.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Me too. I also did.

MURPH: Okay, you beheaded someone before, then. So it should have been your turn. Go ahead.

EMILY: [crosstalk] We’ve all beheaded someone. [laughs]

CALDWELL: So are they still trying to run?

MURPH: Yes, they’re trying to get away.

JAKE: [crosstalk] There’s one guy, right? ‘Cuz one’s dead.

CALDWELL: Are they waylaid by the fact that we started attacking them? Are they slowed?

MURPH: No, they’re just turning and fucking running. The one dude’s dead, the other dude’s just booking it trying to get away.

EMILY: [crosstalk] We got one more. We gotta make sure we silence—

JAKE: [crosstalk] That dude’s just, like, watching—

CALDWELL: Let me check with you if I can do this.

MURPH: Sure.

CALDWELL: While they were attacking the other person, I try to run ahead and set up a rope trap?

MURPH: No. You cannot run ahead of him.

CALDWELL: Okay.

[all laugh]

MURPH: This is not fucking Home Alone.

CALDWELL: [laughs] I don’t know, I’m pretty resourceful.

EMILY:[laughs] “This is not Home Alone.”

MURPH: You can try to trip him or something.

CALDWELL: Yeah, I don’t know if I would be able to tackle him. But like—

MURPH: You could try; you have pretty good strength.

CALDWELL: What I’m gonna try to do, is I’m gonna try and use my shield to shield-tackle him to the ground.

MURPH: Okay, go ahead and run, and just give me a Strength check.

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: Just give me an opposed Strength check. You’re gonna try and grapple him.

CALDWELL: Okay, great. Is that gonna be…

MURPH: So Athletics or Strength.

CALDWELL: My Strength is plus-five—

MURPH: Okay. Plus-five?

CALDWELL: — Athletics, yeah.

MURPH: Oh, that’s a saving throw. Those are your saving throws you’re proficient in. Your Strength is just whatever your modifier is.

EMILY: [crosstalk] He’s a strong boy.

CALDWELL: Oh, it’s plus-three.

MURPH: So just give me a plus-three, unless you have Athletics. Then you can use—

CALDWELL: [rolls die] It’s a sixteen plus three — nineteen. [laughs]

MURPH: [rolls die] Oh my god, nineteen. Fucking Beverly tackles this dude. Like, form-perfect tackle takes this dude down. This dude is just on the ground.

[Emily & Jake laugh]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Pelor!

MURPH: Hardwon, you’re up.

JAKE: [laughs] Shit!

CALDWELL: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

EMILY: [laughs] Go decapitate him! Go decapitate him!

CALDWELL: No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

JAKE: [laughs] Nice and slow stride, walk over.

CALDWELL: I will say, I probably do try to stop him from decapitating yet another human.

MURPH: Okay, okay. So you’re trying—

JAKE: Move!

CALDWELL: Hardwon, no! We’ve… three is probably good!

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Excuse me.

[Emily laughs again]

CALDWELL: I just think that—

JAKE: I raise the greataxe.

CALDWELL: — maybe we could—

MURPH: [laughs] Hardwon’s just slashing, Beverly—

JAKE: [rolls die; laughs] That’s a ten plus fourteen?

MURPH: He’s at disadvantage and everything; you definitely hit him.

CALDWELL: Alright. I guess he is my scoutmaster — I have to respect him now.

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: [rolls die] Yeah, that’s an eleven.

CALDWELL: Alright.

EMILY: [laughs] Ooh!

MURPH: [laughs] He’s just—

CALDWELL: Yes, sir.

MURPH: — so Beverly inadvertently helped execute this man. Beverly’s, like, holding this dude down. Hardwon comes over, and in one big chop, just beheads this man—

[Emily & Jake laugh]

CALDWELL: I was thinking we—

MURPH: — as his head rolls off.

JAKE: I’d like to— yeah. I mostly didn’t hear what you’re saying.

CALDWELL: Sir, just—

JAKE: You know, I’m not a… I wouldn’t… You’re my buddy, but I just, yeah. I killed that guy.

CALDWELL: Normally I’m in favor of just jail, I guess, as a method of dealing with conflict? But—

MURPH: So as you guys are talking, and as this dude’s head rolls down the road—

CALDWELL: Yeah. [laughs]

MURPH: You see Mishka, the half-orc, pokes her head out of the tavern. She says: Bring the bodies inside! More will come soon!

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Ooh shit, Mishka’s cool!

CALDWELL: Okay!

EMILY: Okay, y’all! Yeah, so we drag the bodies inside.

MURPH: You guys drag the bodies, and see that the fishermen are helping fucking clean up and hide the bodies.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: You see Mishka has already, like, gotten rid of—

EMILY: Whoa… now that is hospitality!

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: There you go!

CALDWELL: They carry the bodies, I carry the heads. [laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Now that’s what I was looking for! [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Beverly carries the heads in, and the other people in this tavern—

EMILY: I ask Mishka: Mishka, do you have sort of, like, a pile of trash anywhere? I want to give him a good Crick-elf burial.

MURPH: We’re not going to give them a burial, we’re just going to hide them for now, okay?

EMILY: Okay!

MURPH: They help you guys get rid of the bodies. You see there’s fishermen fucking scrubbing the blood. You see everyone stands in the middle of the tavern. Mishka closes the door, and she looks at you guys and she says: Well, you might be just the guests we needed in this town. And that’s where we’ll end our session.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: [claps] Woo!

JAKE: Dope, dude! Woo!

MURPH: It’s so funny, I didn’t know if you guys were gonna get in a fight with those barbarians but you definitely beheaded all of them.

[Caldwell & Jake laugh]

EMILY: [laughs] I wanted to get into a fight with them so bad, but I knew that I was like, “No, no, no, I’m too much of a sweetheart to.” So I was so pumped when Hardwon went for that.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs; crosstalk] When Hardwon… Hardwon’s just like, “No! I will not buy them a drink!”

JAKE: [laughs; crosstalk] He doesn’t suffer any slight.

EMILY: — because once I become a Symbiotic Entity — AKA a poisonous woman of spores — then I am no longer a sweetheart. I get to act like a savage.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Right, oh yeah.

MURPH: It’s also funny that they all—

JAKE: Those guys were assholes. Like, you offered them water. You offered them your bathtub… your Crick-juice—

EMILY: I gave them my… my bathtub mead to huff.

MURPH: — and it all started because Beverly gave them a note.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Those heads are on you.

MURPH: [laughs] Yeah, those heads are on—

CALDWELL: [laughs] A very firm note! Which I folded so they would open after I left, but, you know.

EMILY: Yeah, you folded it into a little swan. [laughs]

CALDWELL: Exactly! It was a nice little origami swan. While we’re back inside, I do start writing a note to my parents telling them about my new friends that I made.

MURPH: [laughs] Your new scoutmaster who told you to chop somebody’s head off.

EMILY: And me, I’m trying to pick some of the knots out of PawPaw’s hair.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Oh, my God, there’s so many knots. It’s so knotted.

EMILY: [crosstalk] It’s so knotted.

MURPH: Okay, guys, please rate the podcast! This is a new podcast.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Subscribe to it!

MURPH: We could really use it — subscribe to it, baby.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Tell your friends!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Subscribe, baby!

MURPH: Five stars, Not Another D&D Podcast.

JAKE: Let’s word-of-mouth this one, you know what I mean?

MURPH: Yeah.

EMILY: Yeah, could we start a real—

JAKE: Too much ‘rate and subscribe’. Yeah, like, do that — but, like, talk to people.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Yeah, tell people about it.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah, we’re trying to do a grassroots thing here. Make signs!

JAKE: That’s the shit, grassroots.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Get on the subreddit. They already made a subreddit: Not Another DnD Podcast.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh, really? I’m-a hop on the subreddit. Dope.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah, baby.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Ooh!

MURPH: ‘r/’ that baby, check it out. Follow us on Twitter: @JakeHurwitz, @caldy, @eaxford, @chmurph. Guys, February 13th, Emily and I have a book coming out. It’s called ‘HEY, U UP?: How to Turn Your Booty Call into Your Emergency Contact.’

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, that’s true, too.
[Caldwell & Jake laugh]

MURPH: It’s a satirical relationship advice book. Check it out.

EMILY: I gotta think there’s some overlap between people who love D&D and people who love satirical relationship advice books.

CALDWELL: Right.

MURPH: They like us! That’s part of it!

JAKE: That’s the full overlap.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

MURPH: Anybody else got any plugs? Listen to If I Were You with Jake Hurwitz. You’re on that podcast, Jake.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh, yeah, that’s my podcast.

CALDWELL: Yeah, watch Drawfee. [laughs]

MURPH: Yeah, watch Drawfee! Drawfee‘s great!

EMILY: Yeah, watch Drawfee.

CALDWELL: You’re allowed.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Okay, guys, thanks so much.

EMILY: Heck, man, watch The Fall on Netflix. Gillian Anderson’s amazing on that. Can I just plug that? 

[all laugh]

MURPH: [crosstalk] Yeah, and just a recommendation: just check out Gillian Anderson’s The Fall.

EMILY: She just looks so good swimming.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

JAKE: No shit? I will do that.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Oh, and listen to 8-Bit Book Club with me, Caldwell, and Emily.

CALDWELL: Yeah!

EMILY: Yeah, baby.

JAKE: — but not until you’ve seen every episode of The Fall.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: That is correct, yes. You need to be caught up on The Fall to get all of the references. Emily does bring up The Fall a lot.

EMILY: [crosstalk] You really do. Cause there’s spoilers every single week. [laughs]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah.

MURPH: Okay, guys, so we’ll pick up here next week with our intrepid heroes and all of the people in this town, as they’ve just murdered a bunch of people.

JAKE: [crosstalk] I can’t fucking wait.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: Yeah, I mean… I’m thinking that I’m getting back in that kitchen and whipping us up some good jambalaya.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Ooh!

MURPH: [laughs; southern drawl] “Some of that good jambalaya.”

EMILY: Some of that good jambalaya. [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] There’s blood everywhere in this place.

CALDWELL: [laughs; crosstalk] Jamboreen jambalaya!

MURPH: Bahamut keep you all, and may the Baba Yaga not take you this night.

BRIAN MURPHY: Greetings, goblins and ghouls — it’s your Dungeon Master, Brian Murphy. On behalf of the party, I wanted to thank you. We are overwhelmed with the response; the fan-art is so cool! Guys, in the future use #NaDDPod — that’s N-A-D-D-P-O-D — so we can have it all in one place, and everybody check out our subreddit: that’s r/NotAnotherDnDPodcast. That’s ‘D’ — the letter ‘N’ — ‘D’ podcast.

As of right this moment we already have two-hundred and twenty-five reviews, which is a great start, so… tell you what: if you guys can get us up to four-hundred reviews, we’ll release a bonus episode where we will answer your questions about backstory, or the characters, or the adventure so far, or D&D in general — whatever you want.

Additionally, we’re gonna start doing shout-outs for the people who gave us five-star reviews, and that’ll start next week! At the end of the episode the party will do shout-outs for all of our new five-star reviews in character, so be sure to include which character you wanna receive a shout-out from.

Great! Now let me give you a quick recap of what happened last week. In future episodes I’ll do recaps with the whole crew so that they can comment, but we didn’t do that this session so I’ll do it real quick here.

[ambient music plays]

MURPH: Hardwon, Beverly and Moonshine showed up to the fishing village of Moonstone and met at the Hungry Trout Tavern. They were alerted by Beverly’s scoutmaster, Denny, that his troop — the Green Teens — were captured by bullywugs and dragged into a nearby swamp, but before they could go off to save them, they got into a bar fight with some barbarians who have been wreaking havoc on the town. The party bravely decapitated the brutes, then were aided by Mishka, the half-orc bartender, in hiding the bodies… and that’s where we find ourselves now.

[music becomes epic]

Welcome to the campaign after the campaign — this is Not Another D&D Podcast!

MURPH: Welcome back to the realm of Bahumia! I’m your Dungeon Master, Brian Murphy, joined by Jake Hurwitz, Caldwell Tanner, and Emily Axford!

EMILY AXFORD: Who’s Emily Axford? [as Moonshine; southern drawl] I’m Moonshine Cybin!

MURPH: Ooh!

JAKE HURWITZ: [as Hardwon; gruff voice] — and I’m Hardwon Surefoot.


CALDWELL TANNER: [as Beverly; high-pitched, excited voice] Hello, sirs and ma’ams. It’s me: Beverly!

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Ever-proper.

MURPH: Beverly beheaded someone last week.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] — in self-defense!

[Murph laughs]

EMILY: Um — if I may, I believe we all took a chance at beheadin’ someone…

MURPH: Everyone does have one beheading under their belt — except for Hardwon, who has two.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Hardwon has two, yeah.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Moonshine’s was already dead, so… y’know.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] Right.

JAKE: The second beheading was more of an execution.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Yes, Beverly did aid in an execution.

CALDWELL: I politely requested that we not execute the man; I had already gotten my required beheading for my Self-Defense Merit Patch, but my scoutmaster knows best and proceeded —

JAKE: [laughs] He calls me ‘the scoutmaster’ now.

MURPH: Yeah. [laughs] Scoutmaster Denny made you temporary scoutmasters.

EMILY: Yeah, we’re both… Remember, I hocked a loogie and slapped my—

MURPH: [crosstalk] Yeah.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] I’m so lucky—

JAKE: [crosstalk] I’m gonna add that to my list of, like: ‘Pride of the mountain. Scoutmaster.’

EMILY: Yeah!

CALDWELL: Before I had but one scoutmaster; now I have three! Oh, lucky day!

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Okay, so, you guys beheaded these barbarians that you got into a bar fight with.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Correct.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh! Barbarian bar fight — that’s where it comes from.

MURPH: After killing two of them outside the tavern—

EMILY: [crosstalk; laughs] I think that’s where the word ‘barbarian’ comes from. It’s actually—

JAKE: [crosstalk] Bar fight. Bar— yeah. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Bar fight. It’s short for barfightarian. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Barfightarian. Perfect.

CALDWELL: These bares in a bar.

MURPH: So you guys killed these barbarians who were trying— [laughs] — that were fleeing…

[all laugh]

MURPH: You executed fleeing men—

EMILY: I feel like I should point something out about Moonshine Cybin, which is that when she is in Symbiotic Entity mode she has a savageness, and she loses all of her Crick hospitality.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] How—

MURPH: [crosstalk] — sort of a crud-lust.

JAKE: Yeah.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Yes! Yes.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Do you like it?

JAKE: [crosstalk] That’s nice! I like that.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] That’s very good.

EMILY: — or a sludge-lust!

MURPH: Oh, a sludge-lust?!

EMILY: She gets a sludge-lust!

JAKE: Although, if you think about, like: your hospitality sort of take a new shape too. Like… you had to be hospitable to Beverly and me and all of your new friends.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yes! Yes!

JAKE: People were trying to kill us! The most polite thing you could do is kill them first.

EMILY: Yes! I turn into sort of, like, a— I have a spore mentality, and you guys are part of my fungal network.

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: Right, yeah.

EMILY: So then I’m defending the fungal network.

JAKE: That’s your maternal instinct kicking in, that you probably hate.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: You’ve infected us with your spores!

EMILY: Yes.

CALDWELL: — but just, like, at a surface-level, so you know where we are and you can track us, but you haven’t infected us properly yet.

EMILY: Ooh, DM! Can I secretly put some spores on all of them so I can always track them?

MURPH: [crosstalk] Oh, God. Give a Sleight of Hand check, I guess.

CALDWELL: Not a secret now, I suppose.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: — or a… Stealth check? Whaddaya got there?

EMILY: — but I’m asking you, before I do that: if I secretly put some spores on them, could I have, like, Advantage on tracking them in the future?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] — if we go rogue.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Uh… perhaps? We’ll see, depending on the situation.

JAKE: Yeah, we have to be careful about how we brand this thing, ‘cuz if you think about it: we just killed a bunch of people who asked us to buy them a drink… [laughs] — and then summarily executed guys fleeing.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Yeah.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Alright, so here’s where we’re at right now: there’s some beheaded barbarians that Mishka — the half-orc bartender — and some of the fishermen, that were also in the bar, kinda helped you pull inside. They helped clean up the tavern; they’re clearly tired of being pushed around by these barbarians as well, so they help you clean up after your murder.

So you guys are standing in this now-cleaned-up tavern, Mishka’s just closed the door… it’s you guys, the three fishermen, and the old bard who was there, and Mishka — she’s got these scars all down the left side of her face.

JAKE: [unintellible crosstalk] Mhm.

MURPH: She’s all burned-up.

EMILY: Real quick, I’d like to say: Hey, Mishka — real quick, I just wanted to know who these people are. So I just hold up their heads one by one and ask their names.

[all laugh]

MURPH: She looks at the head of the main dude — the bigger guy who gave you guys some problems — and she says: [as Mishka; surly, gruff voice] That one’s name is Kruk.

JAKE: Kruk.

MURPH: — or his name was Kruk.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Kruk! Okay.

MURPH: [crosstalk] He doesn’t have use for names anymore, I guess.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Kruk… is that with a ‘U’?

EMILY: — well, y’know, death is kinda cycle-of-life, so he’ll be back in his own way. Maybe as a tree!

CALDWELL: Aww. Yeah!

JAKE: [imitating Moonshine] “— or a giant mushroom!” [laughs]

[Caldwell & Emily laugh; ominous music plays]

MURPH: You see she walks over and she pulls open his mouth, and she shows you guys that he’s lost a bunch of his teeth — and she does the same with the other two barbarians — and she says:

EMILY: [crosstalk] That’s nuthin’.

MURPH: They’re called the Cracked-Tooth Clan.

JAKE: Oof.

CALDWELL: Ah!

MURPH: They’ve scared off the citizen militia, and the barbarians pretty much run the town now.

JAKE: — but we just killed their leader… right?

EMILY: Was it their leader?

JAKE: Was this their leader? Was Kruk the leader?

MURPH: Kruk is… not the leader.

JAKE: Shit. [laughs]

EMILY: Oh… he was pretty powerful.

JAKE: Yeah, he was hard to kill.

MURPH: The leader is one they call Guresh. He is living in the mayor’s old house. They ran the mayor out of town.

CALDWELL: Is that with a ‘G’?

MURPH: I don’t— They didn’t spell it for me.

CALDWELL: Okay, I’ll just guess! I’ll just do my best.

EMILY: Oh, wow, look at that script! He’s writing in calligraphy! [laughs]

JAKE: So, who are you afraid of? Is it the bullywugs?

MURPH: I am not afraid of the bullywugs. And you see the old bard comes up, and goes: [as old bard; jolly southern accent] Mishka here fought a dragon!

JAKE: O-oh, wh-whoa!

CALDWELL: Whaaat!?

JAKE: [crosstalk] Is that the…?

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, is that where the scar came from? I definitely thought it was a cooking accident.

JAKE: [crosstalk] I didn’t notice a scar! I can’t see it. I—

EMILY: [crosstalk] I assumed maybe you flipped a fish too energetically…

MURPH: [laughs] You see she has, like, one blind, completely white, milky eye.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Hardwon is pretending not to look at it.

JAKE: Oh! I see something… maybe small— I don’t know.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: She goes: Yes, it is true. Before the heroes came, a band of us here from the village tried to face the dragon… and I was the only one who survived.

CALDWELL: Beverly thinks about asking about dragon genitals, but says nothing.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] He blushes slightly.

MURPH: [crosstalk] As you start to pipe up, Scoutmaster Denny’s just like: [as Scoutmaster Denny; high-pitched, stammering, craven voice] Hol-hold on there, now, uh, bud!

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: I pull out my book about dragon anatomy.

MURPH: [laughs] You’re starting to, like, point at the dick and ask about it.

JAKE: He just slowly pushes the book down.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Well, I mean… I’d say, Mishka— I heard that some bullywugs took up some Scout young’uns. We’re probably gonna go save them, ‘cuz, I mean bullywugs— we’ve got bullywugs down by The Crick; they come up about knee-high…

CALDWELL: As a Green Teen I am loyal to my fellow Green Teens, and I must rescue them! It is my sacred charge, as provided by my three scoutmasters!

JAKE: Yeah, this guy gave me a bunch of gold, so I was gonna go too.

EMILY: [crosstalk] — and I got a Green Teen Gift Bag.

MURPH: [crosstalk] — y-yeah, a-a-and a fine Scoutmaster you are, mister Hardwon!

JAKE: Thank you.

[Caldwell laughs]

CALDWELL: I’m proud to serve under your allegiance! [laughs]

MURPH: You see Mishka turns to Scoutmaster Denny in disgust, and she goes: You should’ve never brought them out onto the bay.

JAKE: [crosstalk] That’s where they are.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] — but that’s where the Moon Stone is!

MURPH: They shouldn’t have gone out there with this little coward.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: — but that’s where the—

MURPH: You see Scoutmaster Denny just says: T-to, uh… b-be honest, uh— she’s correct! We should not have gone out! I definitely just sw-s-swam back as soon as I saw them!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Y’all, Moonshine—

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] You raise your finger, like “I object to being called a coward… but no”—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] — but this is where the Jamboreen is! Surely you heard about it; there was a lot of flyers up.

MURPH: The Jamboreen was cancelled.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Super-cancelled.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; laughs] People keep saying that, and I guess I’m having trouble accepting it. [sighs] Well, maybe if we can get the Scouts back from the clutches of these nasty bullywugs, the Jamboreen could be back on — ‘cuz I’m sure it would be a great source of economic growth for the town!

EMILY: Y’know, I’ve got a washboard and two pieces of leafs. I could put on a one-woman show for that Jamboreen!

MURPH: Per-per-perhaps, uh, y-you should help these, uh… the-the Green Teens, before they— uh, they-they-they’re ritualistically sacrificed! [laughs]

JAKE: Oh, yeah; you mentioned that! We should go do that.

CALDWELL: Now, I love a ritual… but sacrifice is no good!

[Jake & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: Let’s go, gang!

EMILY: Um… are we gonna need a boat for this, or can we kinda just wade?

MURPH: You can take one of the boats down at the dock — that’s probably the fastest way around — or you can walk north around the bay to get to the swamp.

JAKE: Boat. We gotta go boat, right?

EMILY: Yeah. Definitely boat.

CALDWELL: I do have my Boat Merit Patch, so I would happily steer the boat for you. I—

JAKE: [crosstalk] Now, does that mean you’ve been in a boat, or you’ve seen a boat? That’s—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] I have read three books about boats—

JAKE: [crosstalk] — okay.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Don’t worry—

MURPH: So, to be clear: he hasn’t even seen a boat.

[all laugh]

JAKE: [laughs] — ‘cuz you got your Bullywug Patch because you dissected a bullywug; not because you fought one, or have seen one, or… okay.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yes! I stared intently at one, yes, this is true.

JAKE: Alright, great. And you’ve also stared intently at a blueprint, I guess, of a boat?

CALDWELL: Galaderon is landlocked.

JAKE: Right.

EMILY: Y’all, it’s easy; I’ll just put PawPaw out the back of the boat and he can kinda kick and, just like, be like a little engine to propel us along.

JAKE: I was raised inside a mountain, so that sounds fine to me. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: If that’s what a boat is, let’s do it! [laughs]

[Emily laughs again]

CALDWELL: I’m just so excited to see a boat!

EMILY: Sounds good.

MURPH: Mishka just shakes her head, and she says: You might want to stop by the temple and talk to one of the druids before you go. They might be able to help you; heal you up, maybe give you something for your journey.

CALDWELL: Okay!

JAKE: [pained voice] Yeah, let’s go see that guy! I have a super-deep axe-wound in my shoulder.

CALDWELL: You are bleeding quite a lot.

JAKE: Yeah.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Yes, you’re very hurt.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Also, as a Druid — would love to hang out with a couple other druids; maybe swap stories, runes, whatnot…

JAKE: [crosstalk; imitating Moonshine] “Spores.”

EMILY: [crosstalk] — spores…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah, as an aspiring Green Knight — always happy to learn from a Druid.

MURPH: Just so you know, she’s going to be so angry that you’re here, because she already told this one… — and she points to Scoutmaster Denny…

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: — that the Jamboreen was cancelled and that he shouldn’t go out on the bay, but then he went out on the bay and now a bunch of kids are missing.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Cool.

MURPH: — and Scoutmaster Denny goes like: Y-y-yep! That’s— that’s right!

JAKE: [laughs] Again raising his— [imitating Scoutmaster Denny] “Once I get… that is true!”

[Murph & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: I’m so excited for my first mission: to save the Jamboreen!

[Murph & Emily laugh again]

MURPH: So Scoutmaster Denny goes: Uh… I-I can— I can show you th-the way to the temple, uh… if you guys want!

CALDWELL: Yes, sir!

EMILY: Yeah, that’d be great!

MURPH: Alright. Mishka looks at you guys as she opens the door to let you out, and she says: The barbarians probably won’t notice that Kruk is gone for the night. He’s a drunken idiot, it’s not unheard of that he would get drunk—

JAKE: [crosstalk] Drunken idiot’s not their most powerful… leader… guy?

MURPH: [crosstalk] No, not even close.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Okay.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Huh.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Okay. Even though he was, like, real powerful, though?

JAKE: [crosstalk] That guy—

EMILY: [crosstalk] He’s, like, close. Hmm.

MURPH: So, these men that you killed? They may not notice them missing for twelve, sixteen, eighteen hours a day, but they will notice eventually, and they will come asking.

CALDWELL: The Green Teen Handbook likes to use the term ‘mortally-corrected’, not ‘killed’. Just, please…. if you don’t mind.

MURPH: You see she just turns from Beverly — just turns right to Hardwon, completely ignoring him.

[Jake laughs]

JAKE: Hardwon nods. That makes sense.

MURPH: [laughs] Okay. They both nod, and then Scoutmaster Denny just goes like: Oh, al-alright, uh… Campers of the Light! U-uh… l-let’s go!

[beat]

CALDWELL: Hurray!

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Only Beverly is into it.

EMILY: Alright, I don’t know about this guy. [laughs]

[all laugh]

MURPH: [laughs] — only Beverly is—

CALDWELL: I’ll take the rear!

MURPH: [laughs] You see Scoutmaster Denny and Beverly start, like, marching off—

JAKE: — they link arms! [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] — and they link arms and start walking off, and Hardwon and Moonshine are just so disgusted.

CALDWELL: I think we start marching off, and then I, like, turn back around and I’m like: Come on! Come on!

JAKE: Alright.

EMILY: I put PawPaw on his leash.

CALDWELL: Good, good, good.

EMILY: I say: I’m sorry, PawPaw, but things gott’n dangerous. You need to get hitched.

MURPH: [laughs] PawPaw’s: [feral possum noises]

[all laugh]

MURPH: — just, like, scrambling… foaming at mouth… he’s going crazier now that he’s on a leash. He’s running, like, the full length of his leash and just yanking at it.

EMILY: [laughs] Yeah, it’s like a viney straightjacket that I strap him into.

[Jake & Murph laugh; nature ambience plays]

CALDWELL: So we’re going to a temple, or…?

MURPH: Ju— uh, yes! It’s a-a-a temple to Melora! O-oh, this is good! I-I-I was actually, uh… preparing some things to teach you, but I never had a chance ‘cuz the Green Teens disappeared!

CALDWELL: [gasps] I pull out my notebook.

[all laugh]

JAKE: Of course.

MURPH: [laughs] Hardwon just rubs his forehead so hard. [laughs]

[all laugh]

MURPH: He just can’t believe… you know, you could’ve sided with the barbarians, but you made your bed… [laughs] — and now you gotta lay in it.

JAKE: This is my crew!

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: So Scoutmaster Denny goes like—

EMILY: [crosstalk] But remember: I’m hot!

JAKE: [crosstalk] Yeah. Yeah. [laughs]

EMILY: I’m attractive!

JAKE: That’s what I keep on reminding myself.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] “Reminder:—“

JAKE: [crosstalk] “The elf is hot. The elf is hot.” [laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] “She’s covered in mushrooms, but she might take a shower at some point. She might take a shower, and the spores might come off. I don’t know.”

[Jake & Emily laugh]

MURPH: So Scoutmaster Denny says: Uh, now the— th-the, er, d-druids here, uh… the town is run by a Druid Circle and a Town Council; uh… that is, uh, the mayor and a-a, er… group of people within the town who help make decisions! Now, uh, as we know, the mayor was run out of town by barbarians, b-b-but there’s still a Druid Circle! Now, er… the mother, Thistle, is at the head of the Druid Circle, but I did not get to talk to her, ‘cuz when I went to the temple, uh… uh, Shae — who is part of the Druid Circle — told me to leave, and said that the Jamboreen was cancelled! So n-n-now we’re gonna go back to that temple—

JAKE: And they also told you not to go out on the bay with the kids. [laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] — and they told… that is, y-y-yes, y-y-yes—

JAKE: [crosstalk] Alright, okay.

MURPH: — they told me not to do that.

EMILY: Why did the bullywugs spare you?

MURPH: Oh— Oh, I-I-I ran!

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: I ran as soon as I saw them! I was— I just jumped on my own boat, and I-I left the teens— I left those teens by themselves!

EMILY: Hmm…

JAKE: [laughs] You are a craven man.

[all laugh]

EMILY: [laughs] Yeah, I gotta be honest, I don’t think I’d treat the young’uns that way.
I wouldn’t—

MURPH: I-I don’t, I… I’m more of a tour guide than a Paladin, really.

[Emily & Jake laugh]

CALDWELL: It’s true that a Green Teen is taught never to run, especially when his friends are being left behind.

MURPH: Well… D— Y-y’know what? Uh, uh… and that’s just why you’re gonna make a great, uh… Junior Green Knight, when you… when you bring— wait—

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Ahhh, you were testing me!

MURPH: I’m testing you!

JAKE: [crosstalk] No— Oh, God. [laughs]

MURPH: Uh, these are your new scoutmasters!

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: They’re the ones that are gonna take you on into the swamp!

JAKE: [crosstalk] Just so you know, we weren’t part of this.

MURPH: So, we’re gonna take you— I’m gonna take you—

EMILY: [crosstalk; laughs] Yeah, I don’t know about this guy.

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: — to a temple of Melora! Now, Melora is the goddess of nature!

EMILY: Hey, maybe—

MURPH: — yes?

EMILY: Maybe when you drop us off, you… I don’t know, go get a drink and go to bed? [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: Are you su— okay, well, I…

JAKE: I think they might not want to see your face at the temple. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Okay—

EMILY: [laughs] Yeah, I’m thinking that you might make us look worse if you come with us.

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: You see he holds up his finger. Th-that is… That is absolutely right!

[Jake laughs again]

EMILY: Yeah, okay.

MURPH: Th-th-the lady druid Shae, t—… s-said that, uh, she did not like me and that I was a coward, and to not take those teens anywhere near the bay. And what did I do? I took them near the bay!

[Jake laughs again]

EMILY: Okay.

JAKE: And then he ran away from the bull— yeah.

MURPH: And then— I did run away!

JAKE: You ditched them, okay.

MURPH: [crosstalk] But yes, uh—

EMILY: Okay, real quick…

MURPH: Mhm?

EMILY: I take a straw hat and I say: Just put this on and sorta, like, pull it over your eyes, so no one would recognize you. [laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] Y-y-yes, ma’am!

[Jake & Emily laugh]

MURPH: — and you see Scoutmaster Denny… [laughs] — puts the straw hat over his face, and he starts leading you guys down to the temple. So you guys—

CALDWELL: As we’re walking, I whisper to him: [whispering] I forgive you!

[all laugh]

MURPH: Th-th-thank you so much, ‘cuz I don’t forgive myself!

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: [whispering] You shouldn’t!

JAKE: [laughs] That‘s dark.

[all laugh]

MURPH: So he takes you guys to this round stone structure, that’s kinda like a dome.

CALDWELL: Mhm.

MURPH: — and it’s completely covered in moss and flowers, and you see a little hut next to it — which you can assume is probably Thistle’s, like, original hut — and now there’s a temple next to it.

CALDWELL: Ahhh.

EMILY: I pluck a little bit of moss and eat it. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: It tastes like grass.

[all laugh]

MURPH: It tastes like dirt and grass.

EMILY: Actually, I just chew on it. [laughs]

MURPH: Sure, you just start chewing.

CALDWELL: Um, I would like to—

MURPH: Scoutmaster Denny turns to you, and goes like: Uh, please don’t do that in the swamp, just eat an-anything.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: Do I know anything about, like the history of this? As a Green Teen?

MURPH: You would know that this was a temple to Melora—

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

MURPH: — who is the nature god — sort of a neutral god — who, you know, was kind of just like, “come what may — there are, y’know, predators and there are prey”. Oh, I just rhymed!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Right; nature is chaos, yeah. Mhm. Right.

MURPH: Yeah, exactly. So, it’s kind of neither good nor bad… just more, like, of the land.

EMILY: What about—

JAKE: [unintelligible crosstalk]

MURPH: — and you know that there is also a little structure that is for Pelor, which is your god…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Aww!

MURPH: — the god of farming and agriculture, and the light, and the song.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Nice! Nice of them to acknowledge.

MURPH: So that’s in the back, yeah.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Who’s my god? Yeah—

EMILY: I have a question.

JAKE: Oh, go ahead.

EMILY: I have a question: how much would I know? Would I know — as, like, a Crick-elf Druid — would I know Melora?

MURPH: You would definitely know Melora.

EMILY: And who’s my god?

MURPH: Probably Melora.

EMILY: Ohhhh!

JAKE: Nice.

CALDWELL: Oh!

JAKE: [unintelligible crosstalk]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Coming hooome!

JAKE: What’s— Do I have a god?

MURPH: You would probably worship a dwarven god. Moradin is the creator-dwarf guy.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Cool.

CALDWELL: I think as we’re walking up to this—

JAKE: What is his name?

MURPH: Moradin.

JAKE: Moradin.

EMILY: Okay so, if we’re going — if this is my god—

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: I take a finger full of mud, and I make the shape of Melora on my forehead.

MURPH: Okay, cool.

CALDWELL: [laughs] The shape—

MURPH: It’s, like… a wave is her symbol.

CALDWELL: Okay, cool.

MURPH: So just a wave in the— [laughs]

EMILY: Yeah, so I draw — and I draw on your foreheads, too.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; whispering] Thank you!

JAKE: [crosstalk] I just shut my eyes in frustration.

MURPH: [crosstalk] It’s just like Ash Wednesday!

[all laugh]

MURPH: So you see… [laughs] — Scoutmaster Denny bows, just this little halfling bow — just this stupid coward in a straw hat…

[all laugh]

MURPH: — just bows and points to the temple and goes: A-As you requested, I will not follow you inside!

EMILY: Yeah, go get a good night’s sleep, okay?

[Jake & Caldwell laugh]

MURPH: Okay, good night everyone! If you don’t come back tomorrow, I’ll try to pay a hunter to find your bodies!

CALDWELL: Good night, sir!

MURPH: Good night!

JAKE: [laughs] I hope he can’t rest that well.

[all laugh]

EMILY: I hope he honestly—

JAKE: I hope he has a hard time falling asleep. [laughs]

MURPH: [laugh] Scoutmaster Denny still has a skip in his step…

[all laugh]

MURPH: — as he, like, walks. [laughs] You can tell he’s, like, totally—

JAKE: — falls asleep as soon as he hits the pillow.

MURPH: [laughs] You shouldn’t know this as not-the-DM, but he does fall asleep as soon as he hits the pillow.

[Jake & Caldwell laugh]

EMILY: I kinda hope… I kinda hope he just, like, leaves town, and goes to another town to start an afterschool program, and does something else with his life.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Oh, Denny…

JAKE: “Do you have any references?” [imitating Denny] “Uh, nope!”

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Denny definitely fails up— [laughs] …career-wise, yeah.

[Emily laughs again]

MURPH: He definitely also has a rich dad.

[Jake & Caldwell laugh]

MURPH: He’s definitely a, like, twenty-two-year-old Junior Green Knight…

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: — when he should be a hero by now.

[Jake & Caldwell laugh again]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] He definitely… yeah.

JAKE: [crosstalk] He had so much gold to—  [laughs; unintelligible crosstalk]

MURPH: [laughs] He does have a lot of gold. He’s a coward! He’s a coward, I don’t know what else to say.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Just a— yeah. Straight up.

MURPH: So you guys are now— so Denny… [laughs] — Denny, with a skip in his step, just skips away…

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: Hmm!

MURPH: — and you guys are now standing in front of this little temple of Melora. There’s no door, it’s just open.

CALDWELL: As he’s leaving, I say: Our dads are friends! [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: That’s right!

CALDWELL: [laughs] Bye! Alright.

EMILY: So as I go in, I take my two blades of grass and I begin to play a song to Melora, in Melora’s honor.

MURPH: Oh, my God.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

MURPH: [laughs] Roll me a Performance check.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: Hell yeah!

EMILY: [laughs] Oh, shit.

[Jake & Caldwell laugh]

EMILY: I believe I should have some kind of…

MURPH:  I think it’s probably just Charisma.

EMILY: [crosstalk] I mean, I’m proficient in my musical instrument, though.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Are you?

EMILY: Yeah. I have a tool proficiency in my musical instrument.

MURPH: Oh, sweet!

EMILY: So what do I add— oh, I add my proficiency bonus.

MURPH: [crosstalk] So you add, like— yeah.

EMILY: [laughs] Okay.

MURPH: [laughs] Read your character sheet.

[Caldwell laughs; Emily rolls]

CALDWELL: Ooh! Seventeen!

EMILY: Ooh, baby! Twenty-one!

MURPH: Twenty-one!?

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh, dude, she fucking brings the house down!

MURPH: She pulls out two grass blades to her lips—

JAKE: I’m like: Hey, what are you doing!?

EMILY: [crosstalk] And I make up—

MURPH: [crosstalk] — and she’s been a fucking nutcase at this point.

[Jake & Emily laugh]

MURPH: She’s got a possum on a leash…

JAKE: [crosstalk] She ate moss.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk; laughs] — just going absolutely nuts, she just ate handful of moss… She starts playing—

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Rubbed dirt on her forehead.

[Emily sings flute noises]

MURPH: [crosstalk] Hardwon, since you’re— You live with the dwarves, so they’re not, like, as musical or sentimental, and halflings, like, enjoy a good tune.

CALDWELL: Oh, sure, I think that I would probably accompany her with my angelic boy voice.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Sure. [laughs] So these two just start playing this beautiful duet.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh.

MURPH: He’s singing about Pelor, and she’s playing this beautiful… it sounds like a flute.

[Emily continues to sing flute noises]

CALDWELL: [singing in falsetto] ♬ Pelor and Melora, they dance in the flora! ♬

JAKE: So nothing like that. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Nothing like this; it sounds beautiful. It’s one of the most — probably the most — beautiful song you’ve ever heard.

JAKE: Mhm.

MURPH: As you guys enter this…

EMILY: Is it affecting animals as we walk by?

MURPH: [laughs] There are no animals out.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Except for PawPaw.

[Caldwell laughs again]

MURPH: You can see there are like, flowers and stuff… [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] You really calm this PawPaw. [laughs]

MURPH: Yeah. No, yeah— PawPaw calmed down.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Aw, yeah.

MURPH: PawPaw calmed down and he, like, got up, and he’s furiously licking your face.

[Emily laughs again]

MURPH: — and it is really hard for you to play and maintain concentration because PawPaw’s just going in on that cheek.

[Emily laughs again]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] This song is called— yeah… It’s called PawPaw’s Melody— PawPaw’s Lullaby.

[Emily laughs; mysterious music plays]

MURPH: So you guys enter the temple, and as you step inside you see moonlight shining from the top of, like, the domed roof.

CALDWELL: Ooooh.

EMILY: [gasps; imitating a spectral voice] “Moonshiiine.”

MURPH: There’s like a circular window at the top,l that lets light shine down onto the floor of the temple…

EMILY: Can I sparkle in moonlight?

MURPH: [laughs] …you could go step under the moonlight. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] You would look pretty majestic, sure.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah, you probably—- yeah, you’re dew-y.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Does any of us— yeah.

JAKE: [crosstalk] It just bounces off the ‘shrooms.

MURPH: Sure. So the moon… [laughs] — the moonlight bounces off the ‘shrooms, making Moonshine just look radiant.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] So, under—

JAKE: [crosstalk] Hardwon’s like: Damn, she is really hot.

[all laugh]

MURPH: [laughs] Yeah. Hardwon’s like, “Shit, if she took a shower…”

[Jake & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: Beverly is uncomfortable, and washes his hands.

[Murph & Emily laugh]

MURPH: [laughs] Beverly just goes to, like, a holy fountain and starts washing his hands, like he’s taking a bath.

[all laugh]

EMILY: [laughs] Muttering a prayer of penance.

MURPH: [laughs] He just takes a bath in a bird fountain.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Okay, so you guys see that, like, under this window that’s shining moonlight, there is, like, a garden on the floor of the temple…

EMILY: Ooh! [gasp]

MURPH: — with, like, soft green grass and flowers.

CALDWELL: Oh!

EMILY: [crosstalk] This is beautiful.

MURPH: There are wooden bookshelves along the walls, and, like, various tables with, like, scrolls and potions, and then there’s an altar below a hanging tapestry with the wave-like symbol of Melora. And you see a white-haired, ageless-looking Druid woman, like a… like a yoga mom? I would say?

[Caldwell laughs]  

JAKE: [crosstalk] Cool.

MURPH: [crosstalk] M’kay, like a yoga mom.

EMILY: This is my freaking dream, to be white-haired and ageless.

MURPH: So she’s white-haired and ageless, and she’s meditating in the moonlight.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Right.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, my God… I—

MURPH: — and, even as you guys play this song and everything, she’s just paying you no mind.

CALDWELL: Is this just the Moon Juice woman?

[beat]

MURPH: [crosstalk] The Moon Juice woman?

EMILY: [crosstalk] I have to be— …yeah. [laughs] This is the Moon Juice woman.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Emily knows what I’m talking about! [laughs]

EMILY: Like that… L.A. Moon Juice— like, Gwyneth Paltrow…

CALDWELL: [unintelligible crosstalk]

MURPH: Yes, this— she is… she is Goop.

EMILY: Okay, so—

CALDWELL: [laughs] Is that her name!?

MURPH: [laughs] No.

CALDWELL: Aww…

MURPH: They told you that her name is Shae. [unintelligible crosstalk]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Coming into this, I did not know Moonshine’s sexuality… but Moonshine is desperately attracted.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: Sure.

EMILY: Her ovaries are, like… she can feel them—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] — thrumming.

EMILY: — throbbing against her stomach. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Wow.

CALDWELL: Thrumming and throbbing.

JAKE: Ooh! Does that play into your, like, fertileness?

EMILY: [laughs] Yeah.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Interesting.

EMILY: Just, like, releasing eggs at looking at her. [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: I’d like to imagine they’re just like cartoon maracas.

EMILY: Yeah. [laughs]

MURPH: So, you guys show up and Moonshine is just l—

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: — everyone is just lustily looking at this Druid woman who’s meditating on the ground.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

JAKE: [laughs] Everyone’s just horny.

MURPH: Yeah, everyone’s just standing there. Everyone’s standing there very horny.

CALDWELL: Two episodes in and we’re already horny.

MURPH: Yeah.

JAKE: Totally forgot about the kids.

MURPH: Yeah, Moonshine, why don’t you go ahead and roll for Horniness. See how horny you are.

EMILY: Okay, yeah. [rolls die]

[Jake laughs]

EMILY & CALDWELL: Eleven.

EMILY: What do I add to that, Charisma?

MURPH: Uh, yeah.

EMILY: And I’m also proficient in it, so…

CALDWELL: [laughs] Oh, shit.

MURPH: Yeah, proficient Horniness.

EMILY: Gonna be a fifteen.

MURPH: [crosstalk] That’s a fifteen, okay. Pretty horny.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] That’s pretty horny.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Sweet.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Okay, as Beverly takes a bath in the birdbath…

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

[Emily laughs again]

MURPH: — washing his hands—

CALDWELL: [laughs] — and my feet!

MURPH: — you see she’s meditating, and without opening her eyes, she says: [as Shae; soft, serious voice] I told you kids the Jamboreen was cancelled.

CALDWELL: WE’RE HERE TO SAVE THE JAMBOREEN!

[Murph & Jake laugh]

EMILY: Okay, okay! Actually… [clears throat] Hi.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Moonshine Cybin; friend of the fungus, lover of decay. We’re actually here because we’re gonna save the young’uns from the bullywugs.

CALDWELL: It’s true!

JAKE: Yeah. Yeah, I’m not here for the Jamboreen.

CALDWELL: We’ve been charged with the sacred quest to save my fellow Green Teens!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah… I’m just sort of, like, a budding hero.

MURPH: She’s still stilling with her legs crossed, and she says: What do you mean — they got taken by bullywugs? I told that little idiot not to take them anywhere near the bay!

CALDWELL: He took them very close to the bay, so he could teach them about the Moon Stone!

[Emily & Murph laugh]

JAKE: Don’t worry about him, though, he’s fine. He ran away…

[all laugh]

MURPH: Cut to Scoutmaster Denny sleeping in one of the rooms above The Hungry Trout Inn. [laughs]

EMILY: — with, like, a hot milk next to him. He’s just, like, really enjoying himself

JAKE: [crosstalk] — having a pleasant dream.

MURPH: [laughs] He’s staying in the biggest room with a king-sized bed, ‘cuz his dad’s so rich.

CALDWELL: So feathery. He’s wearing a nightcap, absolutely. He’s got a little, like, candle next to his bed that he’s blowing out.

EMILY: [laughs] Yeah.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Yeah, so—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] We have come here seeking healing and supplies for our journey to SAAAVE the JAMBOREEN!

JAKE: — save the kids.

EMILY: — the young’uns! We’re here for the young’uns.

JAKE: [crosstalk] You can still cancel the Jamboreen.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: The Jamboreen will be saved!

[all laugh]

MURPH: [laughs] You see she turns… [laughs] — once again she turns away from the other two, and looks right at Hardwon, and says…

[Jake & Caldwell laugh]

CALDWELL: ‘Kay.

EMILY: No, I was sayin’ we were savin’ the young’uns!

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: I’m on your side, girl. Hi; fellow worshiper of Melora. I reach out my hand.

MURPH: She reluctantly takes your hand.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] I hold it until she— [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh, too long.

MURPH: She gets some spores on her hand.

EMILY: My hand’s crawling up her wrist. [laughs]

MURPH: Oh, my God! She pulls back.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: I offer her some, like, hand tonic to clean— it’s like the fantasy equivalent of, like, sanitation gel.

MURPH: Sure.

CALDWELL: I hand her some of that to clean her hands.

MURPH: Do, like, a Persuasion check.

CALDWELL: Oh, let me see… Oh! I have a plus-six in Persuasion!

MURPH: See if this woman likes you.

CALDWELL: Alright. [rolls die] Eighteen plus six.

MURPH: Oh, dope. Okay.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: So she…

JAKE: [crosstalk] Should check if—  [unintelligible crosstalk]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Hey, Murph? Murph? I’m a very good boy.

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: Beverly IS a very good boy.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: [laughs] Yeah.

MURPH: So you see she turns, and you hand her, like, some hand sanitizer.

CALDWELL: I think it’s like an aloe leaf.

MURPH: Okay, you hand her an aloe leaf, and she breaks, and laughs, and she tussles your hair and says:

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Child, I’m a Druid of Melora, I don’t need to wash my hands. I’m okay with dirty hands, I think.

CALDWELL: Okay, I just— they just look kind of dirty.

JAKE: It’s kind of gross.

EMILY: [laughs] I’m rolling around in the mud in the corner.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Okay. Once again she just turns to Hardwon. Nah, she just turns to Hardwon and Beverly as she’s rolling— rolling in the mud.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Talks to the adult in the room.

MURPH: She says: I need to be here to protect the people of this town, especially with the barbarians, so I can’t go with you into the swamp. But, if there are children in trouble, I will help you as best I can.

JAKE: Awesome.

MURPH: — and you see she heals you guys fully. She’s a powerful enough druid that—

CALDWELL: Nice!

EMILY: How does she heal? Is it, like, distance, or touch?

JAKE: [crosstalk] You want touch so bad!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Please.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] She heals Beverly by touch—

[Caldwell moans]

MURPH: — she heals Hardwon by touch, and heals you by distance.

[Emily & Jake laugh]

EMILY: I’m like: Oh, I think I might not be fully healed! Maybe you wanna do one of them touch-heals on me.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Beverly does not like the touch. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Oh, God. Okay, so she looks at you guys and says: I can give you some things that will help you on your journey, but please, be careful while you’re out there. There’s worse in that swamp than bullywugs.

CALDWELL: Like…?

JAKE: Shit.

EMILY: Like what?

CALDWELL: Like, what’s worse th… like, two bullywugs?

MURPH: There are many bullywugs.

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: They usually have a king of some sort; some type of shaman.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: There are trolls in the swamp…

CALDWELL: Ooh!

EMILY: What? These sound nothing like Crick bullywugs.

MURPH: I don’t know what bullywugs are like at The Crick, but out here they’re—

EMILY: About knee-high! ‘Bout knee-high!

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: They’re taller than knee-high here.

EMILY: Oh! Okay.

CALDWELL: I’m knee-high!

MURPH: You are knee-high, little one.

CALDWELL: Huh.

MURPH: You’re a very good boy. — and she tussles your hair.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: ‘Bout knee-high, they make a lot of noise at night… it’s kind of annoying.

MURPH: Sure. Well, I’ll give you these to help you get across the bay quickly. — and she hands you these three scrolls; they are Scrolls of Water Walking.

CALDWELL: Ooh!

[Emily gasps]

MURPH: They let you walk on water for, like, twenty minutes.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Dope.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Whoa!

MURPH: She hands you Scrolls of Water Walking, and she also gives you guys each a Potion of Healing.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Aw, write that down!

EMILY: [crosstalk; gasps] Wow!

JAKE: [crosstalk] That’s awesome.

MURPH: So you guys are all healed up to full health…

EMILY: Can I— I would like to just take her aside. I’m not gonna do anything creepy.

MURPH: Sure.

EMILY: I’m just saying: I come bearin’ the spore of The Crick, and I’m tryin’-a sort of spread it to spread our word, spread our message, spread our people — we’re a hospitable people. I would love to plant just, y’know, a handful of spores in this beautiful garden.

MURPH: You’re more than welcome to leave your mark.

EMILY: Thank you so much.

CALDWELL: I approach her with my— I have a little booklet that is labelled ‘Interfaith Relationships’ — and I say: I’m working on my Interfaith Relationships Merit Patch; could you please sign this to say that I’ve communed with a hostess of Melora? As a representative of Pelor, it is important for our two faiths to intermingle and work together!

MURPH: Absolutely.

CALDWELL: Yesssss! YEEEESSSSS!

MURPH: — and she says: Who should I make this out to? What’s your name?

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: My name is Beverly. Beverly Toegold, the fifth!

MURPH: Beverly Toegold, the fifth… — and she signs your little book.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Beverly, I have to sign that too, as your scoutmaster.

CALDWELL: Could you, please? Yeah, everyone has to sign this. Everyone sign it, please.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Oh, you’re the scoutmaster. You do know that it’s cancelled, right? The whole retreat? [laughs]

JAKE: — and it’s not coming back on.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Temporarily cancelled, yes.

JAKE: [laughs] It’s permanently cancelled.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh — for now!

JAKE: [crosstalk] — as your scoutmaster—

MURPH: [crosstalk; laughs] Right, right, yes.  Yes, I expressly, specifically told the scoutmaster, Denny, that it was cancelled.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Right… yeah, Denny, ugh. He… [laughs] He’s a bad guy. I don’t know what to tell you.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: — for the time being, yes.

EMILY: When you hand it to Moonshine to sign, she looks really confused and tries to pretend like she knows how to write. [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] She kind of just scribbles with both hands on it— [unintelligible crosstalk]

MURPH: [laughs] She just makes her mark.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Yeah, I feel like I just whisper to her: [whispers] An ‘X’ is fine!

[Emily & Caldwell laugh]

MURPH: Okay! So she shows you guys out, and as you guys are leaving the temple, she looks at you guys and she says: Good luck; may Melora bless you.

EMILY: You as well.

CALDWELL: — and Pelor keep you as well!

MURPH: She nods. Thank you.

EMILY: …do you want one of these little mud-spots I did?

MURPH: No, actually, I do not.

EMILY: Okay.

CALDWELL: [laughs] It’s actually pretty soothing!

EMILY: It’s nice, yeah.

CALDWELL: Yeah, it’s working well on my acne.

EMILY: It’s the love of Melora!

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Beverly is covered in acne.

[all laugh]

EMILY: Uh-huh, you do have a lot of that.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh. So, should we head for the bay?

EMILY: Yes.

JAKE: Let’s go to the bay.

CALDWELL: Hurray!

EMILY: Let’s do it!

MURPH: Dope. So you guys—

JAKE: Beverly tries to do the ‘linked-arms skipping’ with us.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Yeah, I try to link arms with both of them and skip.

JAKE: I’m good.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh; ocean ambience plays]

MURPH: You guys walk through the village, and as you get down to the docks and the bay… as you approach the water, it gets brighter and brighter. You can see the water lighting up in, like, a bright, translucent white with a pale-blue glow, and even from here — even from, like, twenty, thirty feet away — you can see movement in the water, of, like, the various fish swimming around.

JAKE: Yeah.

MURPH: By the dock, you see there are several, like, small fishing boats docked there, and sitting on the dock is a singular half-orc barbarian, with, like, a ponytail…

CALDWELL: Huh. Ooh…

MURPH: — and he looks more a shaman — he’s got, like, pelts and stuff — and you see he’s kind of meditating on the dock there.

EMILY:  We could try to charm this guy… although, if he’s a shaman he probably has—

CALDWELL: [laughs]  He’s meditating, right? Couldn’t we just sneak past him? [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] We got permission to use the boat anyway.

MURPH: [crosstalk] You see him just… right now he has his back to you. He’s looking out at the water, so you kind of…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Okay.

EMILY: [crosstalk] We have Water Walk, though, bitches. Who needs boats?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah. Alright, so—

JAKE: — but we should— should we save them in case something happens to the boat?

CALDWELL: Murph, just to paint a picture: he’s at the end of, like, a long, narrow dock? Is that what we’re saying?

MURPH: Yes.

CALDWELL: Why don’t we just, like, walk around the side of the dock and go around him? [laughs]

MURPH: You can literally do whatever you want. Do you wanna avoid him? Do you wanna speak to him? What do you wanna do?

CALDWELL: If he’s a shaman and he’s meditating, I feel like we could maybe—

EMILY: What if we just left a note at his feet? That worked so well last time. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: He does have the same ponytail of, like, the other barbarian dudes. So he’s definitely with them, from what you can tell.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Okay. Alright. Yeah we—

EMILY: [crosstalk] Ohh, okay. Okay. So should we try to sneak?

JAKE: [crosstalk] Yes. Let’s sneak around this dude.

EMILY: [crosstalk] I think we should just try to sneak around him.

CALDWELL: Yeah. Should we try to give him a wedgie?

[beat]

JAKE: [crosstalk] …no, Beverly.  [laughs] You’re a good boy!

EMILY: [crosstalk] No!

CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay. That was Caldwell talking. Beverly would never.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: So did you guys wanna take the kind of long way around?

CALDWELL: Not the super-long way; I’m thinking we just kinda, like, start from the beach, and, like, water-tiptoe around this guy.

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: — and Stealth.

CALDWELL: Mhm.

MURPH: So you guys walk far away. Are you guys gonna use the scrolls, or are you guys gonna try to take a boat?

JAKE: I vote boat — and then, like, we’ve got the scrolls…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] What?

EMILY: [crosstalk]  I think that’s a good idea, ‘cuz the scrolls only last so long.

JAKE: [crosstalk] — ‘cuz we gotta put the kids in the boats!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah.

CALDWEL: [crosstalk] Ohhh, use the scrolls as a backup. Cool.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah.

CALDWELL: Murph, double-check in the Explorer’s Pack; does it have a telescope in it? A little spyglass?

MURPH: [laughs] You can have a spyglass if you’d like, sure.

CALDWELL: Okay!

EMILY: Oh, my gosh — we should get a boat that looks like a fishing boat, so if he sees us he thinks we’re just late-night fishin’.

JAKE: Smart.

CALDWELL: Yeah! Good, good, good.

EMILY: Okay.

MURPH: Alright, so there are only kind of small fishing boats, since this village has kind of constantly been in peril.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh. [laughs]

MURPH: There’s never been a time where they’ve had, like, big, commercial fishing boats or anything but you guys can take, like, a small fishing boat, if you’d like.

CALDWELL: Yeah!

EMILY: Yeah, and we’re gonna set up the, like, fishing…

JAKE: — lines.

EMILY: — lines, so it looks like we’re just, like, fishing.

CALDWELL: A little trawler!

MURPH: Okay, cool. So you guys kind of by—

JAKE: Just like you pretend you know how to write, I pretend I know how to set up a fishing line. [laughs]

[Emily laughs; sounds of lapping waves play]

MURPH: So you guys bypass this dock and kinda get away from this barbarian dude, and you guys walk further and further down the bay. Does somebody want to give me a ‘search’ check?

EMILY: Yeah…

CALDWELL: Yeah!

JAKE: Who’s good at it?

MURPH: Is ‘search’ a skill? Why do I keep telling you guys—

EMILY: [crosstalk] Search isn’t…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Would that just be Perception?

EMILY: Perception? Okay.

MURPH: Yeah, go ahead and give me a Perception check.

CALDWELL: Alright.

EMILY: [roll die] I got eighteen!

MURPH: Eighteen, great.

CALDWELL: Great!

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh, we’re able to find some fishing shit!

MURPH: You’re able to find a… You find a boat that has some fishing poles, like, tucked under the seats.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

EMILY: What about some worms and some bait?

MURPH: [laughs] You do not find that. They’re not just gonna leave their worms in their boat.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: I leave a note and some gold. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] In the boat that you’re taking?

CALDWELL: No, in, like… the fishery.

MURPH: Oh, okay. Got it.

CALDWELL: — to say, like, “thank you for letting us borrow your equipment.”

MURPH: Great.

JAKE: He signs his name for some reason, and I cross it off.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh. [laughs]

JAKE: Let’s not let them know.

EMILY: [crosstalk; laughs] You write a different name.

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] Yeah… “Denny.” [laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk; laughs] “Denny!” [laughs]

CALDWELL: Is this my nickname?

MURPH: Cool. So you guys take off on the boat.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

MURPH: You guys get out into the bay. As you are riding across the bay you can see all the fish swimming up, and it is so easy to fish here that literally big yellowfin tuna and stuff are, like, just, like, jumping into your boat, flapping at you, and smacking you in the face… just jumping all over the place.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: I think I’m just scootin’ ‘em out! I’m kickin’ ‘em back out.

CALDWELL: No, no, wait! I think we should hold onto them; we could maybe use them to bargain with later on.

JAKE: Or eat.

CALDWELL: Or eat!

[Murph laughs]

EMILY: I think you guys can hold onto them, I’m probably just kickin’ ‘em back out, being like: Git! Git!

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Yeah.

MURPH: PawPaw’s just furiously eating a halibut.

[Emily & Jake laugh]

MURPH: Just tearing at one.

EMILY: PawPaw!

CALDWELL: Yeah, I feel like I— how long a journey is this?

MURPH: Not super-long.

CALDWELL: Okay, so I wouldn’t have time to, like, skin a fish, and, like—

MURPH: It’d probably be, like, fifteen minutes.

CALDWELL: I could skin a fish in fifteen minutes!

MURPH: [laughs] Okay.

JAKE: We eatin’ sushi.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah, I prepare sashimi for everyone.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk; laughs] Alright, I’ll have that. What’s this!? What’s this halfling food!?

MURPH: [crosstalk] Great. [laughs] Beverly makes some really great sushi that everyone gets super sick from.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Roll for how many bones you swallow.

[Jake & Caldwell laugh]

MURPH: So you guys get to the other side of the bay, and you find this abandoned, dilapidated dock. You see that the wood is soaked through with water damage. You see spots of green moss and fungi…

JAKE: [crosstalk] Your favourite.

MURPH: [crosstalk] — a few jagged planks stick out across the walkway…

EMILY: Can I collect some of that fungi?

MURPH: Sure. You go over, grab some fungi.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: Mhm.

EMILY: Ooh! What kind is it?

MURPH: Let’s see! Let’s roll and see if it’s poisonous.

[all laugh]

MURPH: It is… [rolls die] — safe to eat.

CALDWELL: [chanting] Eat it!

EMILY: Well, I’m not gonna eat it, I’m just gonna put it in the spore library.

CALDWELL: Oh, gotcha.

MURPH: Alright. This is, like, a blue-cap mushroom.

CALDWELL: So, this is, like, a little island?

MURPH: No. So it’s a bay — so it kind of is like a ‘sideways horseshoe’ into the land.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: So the south side of the bay is the village, and north of it is the swamp.

CALDWELL: Mhm. Okay.

MURPH: So it’s this big expanding swamp.

CALDWELL: Gotcha.

MURPH: So, you guys — standing on this dilapidated dock, facing out from the bay — you see this great, expanding swamp, and you see the hanging leaves of, like, the mangrove trees…

JAKE: Ooh.

EMILY: Oooooh!

MURPH: — and the weeping willows make it like impossible to see through. You do notice, though, at, like, the edge of the swamp you see a broken spear and a longsword stuck in the mud.

CALDWELL: Hmm.

EMILY: ‘Broken spear and a longsword stuck in the mud.’ Okay. So presumably that’s some sort of, like, warning, to, like, stay away?

CALDWELL: Or an entrance! [laughs]

JAKE: Or there could be, like, people guarding that area, and they just, like, went to take a pee or something?

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: Can we do, like, a Perception check to see…?

CALDWELL: That seems wise.

MURPH: Yeah, go ahead! Go ahead to do, like, an Investigation check.

CALDWELL: Murph, while Emily’s doing that—

MURPH: You guys can all roll for Investigation.

EMILY: [rolls die] I got eighteen!

JAKE: Oh, hell yeah!

MURPH: Perfect! There was a fight here. There was clearly a fight here. You see that people were—

JAKE: [rolls die] I got a four, so Hardwon looked around and didn’t see shit. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Yeah, Hardwon doesn’t see shit.

JAKE: Looks fine to me!

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Hardwon still thinks that somebody left it as a mark that it’s the entrance.

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: But there was definitely a struggle here; you see that somebody was dragged into the swamp.

CALDWELL: Gotcha.

EMILY: Do I see anyone, like, in the trees, or anything like that?

MURPH: No, you do not.

CALDWELL: Do we see maybe any torn neckerchiefs or merit badge sashes? [laughs]

MURPH: You do not here, but you do notice that— when you pick up the longsword, you see that it’s identical to your Green Teen longsword.

CALDWELL: Huh. Guys, this sword is identical to mine!

JAKE: What do you think that means, Beverly?

CALDWELL: [laughs] Hmm… Beverly thinks for a little too long about it.

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] A full, silent minute.

EMILY: [laughs] Somebody hasn’t gotten his Critical Thinking Badge yet… [laughs]

CALDWELL: Still working on that one!

EMILY: Okay.

CALDWELL: I think that the Green Teens were here. Before we proceed, I want to ask: when Shae healed us, did that replenish our spell slots and whatnot?

MURPH: Yeah— no.

CALDWELL: Okay, cool. Great.

JAKE: [imitating Caldwell] “Cool, cool, good, good, good, good. And it didn’t do anything for my acne either.” [laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] I feel like it cleared it up a little bit.

[Jake & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: Lookin’ fresh-faced. Lookin’ good.

MURPH: Alright—

CALDWELL: Hmm… I wonder if I could… I don’t think there would be magic on these bullywugs. I don’t think I could detect an aura on this sword, or anything like that.

MURPH: No.

CALDWELL: Although, could I detect the magic from the other Green Teens?

MURPH: No—

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: The purpose of Detect Magic is to, like, see if something is magical. Like, if you go to a door or something and it’s sealed closed, you could see if there’s a spell holding it closed. It’s not to, like, track someone.

CALDWELL: Okay, we’re goin’ in blind! [laughs]

EMILY: Okay, y’all — I think we’re gotta Stealth in, ‘cuz I’m gettin’ goose pimples. This place does not feel that hospitable.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh.

MURPH: [crosstalk] So her Investigation check was really good; you do see someone was dragged in there, and you do see that it is pretty easy to follow the tracks because it’s super-thick muck.

CALDWELL: Alright. Okay.

EMILY: Can we Stealth in a boat?

MURPH: You’re not in the boat.

JAKE: Yeah, we’re walking through the muck now.

EMILY: Oh, wait, we’re walking. We’re walking. Okay.

CALDWELL: Yeah, we’re off the boat.

EMILY: Ooh, we’re in the muck!

CALDWELL: We’re in it!

JAKE: Yeah, so let’s follow the tracks, nice and stealthy.

CALDWELL: Yep, sounds good!

MURPH: Alright, you guys are Stealthing?

CALDWELL: Uh-huh!

MURPH: Everyone go ahead and tell me in what order everyone’s going. Is somebody, like, scouting ahead, or is…?

EMILY: Um… who has the best Stealth?

JAKE: Oh…

CALDWELL: I have Nimbleness! It would probably be me.

EMILY: It would probably be you…

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: [crosstalk] It should say… you have a Stealth skill.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Although, you’re also wearing heavy armour.

MURPH: Yeah, you’re not gonna be great at stealth.

CALDWELL: Hmm… my Stealth is plus-two.

JAKE: Okay, I’m bad.

EMILY: I’m only plus-two.

[beat]

MURPH: No one’s good at Stealth?

JAKE: Oh, it’s under Dex. I’m plus-four.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: Oh! Okay, yeah!

EMILY: Plus-four — so maybe Hardwon goes first, then I’ll go, and then we’ll keep little Beverly in the back.

CALDWELL: Okay. Yeah.

MURPH: So, are you guys following at enough of a distance that Hardwon’s gonna kinda run into any trouble before anyone else is? Or are you guys close together?

CALDWELL: Yeah. I feel like we should let Hardwon be the scouting party.

MURPH: Alright. So you’re, like, twenty feet ahead.

JAKE: Okay.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: Are you cool with that?

JAKE: Hardwon fears nothing, though he should.

[swamp ambience plays]

MURPH: Cool. So you’re gonna be the primary Stealth roll, because you’re the one that’s kinda scouting ahead. So Hardwon…

[Jake rolls die]

MURPH: [laughs] — starts going after these tracks… [laughs]

JAKE: Oh, fuck.

MURPH: [laughs] That’s a nine. Huh.

EMILY: Ooh…

JAKE: That’s… yeah, that’s… that’s, uh… [laughs]

EMILY: Oh, I should’ve— wait, a swamp wouldn’t count as woods, right? Mask of the Wild wouldn’t have any effect here?

MURPH: Mask of the Wild?

CALDWELL: That’s very cool?

MURPH: Yeah, that counts as woods.

EMILY: — it means in woods it’s easier for me to hide.

MURPH: Sure! Yeah!

JAKE: Oh, shit!

CALDWELL: Oh, yeah.

EMILY: So I should’ve gone first. We’ll know for the future!

CALDWELL: Yep, okay. Hindsight.

MURPH: Okay. [laughs] But for now, Hardwon just is making loud sounds in the muck walking.

[Jake laughs; makes squelching noises]

EMILY: Just, like: [makes squelching noises]

JAKE: [laughs] Just sucking up my boot.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah, Hardwon, like, sneaks forward two steps, then, like, steps on a bird. [laughs; makes cawing noise]

JAKE: That would’ve happened to anybody! [laughs]

MURPH: Hardwon, as you walk ahead, you turn just in time to see a spear being thrown at you.

CALDWELL: [laughs] A spear heading right towards you.

MURPH: [rolls die] And… that is going to be a seventeen to hit? Does that hit you?

JAKE: [crosstalk] Agh!

MURPH: What’s your AC? Sixteen; it does hit you.

[battle music plays]

JAKE: Dammit.

CALDWELL: Uh-oh! Sounds like we’re about to hit that niche!

EMILY: Yeah!

JAKE: Hardwon’s going down.

MURPH: [rolls die] He got hit for seven.

JAKE: Oh, boy.

[Emily whistles]

MURPH: So you get hit with a spear for seven. Everybody go ahead and roll me Initiative!

CALDWELL: Alright!

EMILY: Okay! [rolls die]

MURPH: Actually, wait— there’s two of them. Sorry, the other guy’s going to throw a spear at Hardwon in the surprise round.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Oh, cool!

MURPH: [rolls die] — and he’s gonna hit, too. I’m so sorry, Hardwon.

JAKE: Oh, dude! No!

[Murph rolls die]

EMILY: Ohh!

MURPH: Another six. [laughs]

JAKE: Wait — so that’s twelve total?

MURPH: Twelve total.

JAKE: Oh, boy.

MURPH: Okay, so… [laughs] — everybody roll Initiative. [laughs]

EMILY: [laughs] Hardwon just, like, collapses, like, into…

JAKE: [crosstalk] Don’t worry, guys! I got this! [makes two impact noises]

[all laugh]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Instantly hit by two spears.

MURPH: [crosstalk; laughs] Instantly gets hit with two spears.

CALDWELL: This is such a good turn from Hardwon in Episode One, where he was so confident and cool.

EMILY: [laughs] I know!

JAKE: Right after I got fully-healed by the Druid lady, too…

[Murph laughs

CALDWELL: [rolls die] got a ten!

EMILY: I got eleven!

[Jake rolls die]

MURPH: What’d you get, Hardwon?

JAKE: Eleven, but is that plus… what?

MURPH: Yes, plus your Dex.

JAKE: Uh… four.

MURPH: Dope! So fifteen.

JAKE: Fifteen.

MURPH: Hardwon: you get to respond. [laughs]

JAKE: Woo!

MURPH: [crosstalk] You turn and you see these beady—

EMILY: [crosstalk] Hardwon runs! [laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Ten-ten sprint to wherever Denny is.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] You can kind of sprint towards where you saw the spears being thrown, and there are two of these bullywugs — these little frogmen who are probably, like, four-feet tall and kind of burly. Kind of, like, the works.

JAKE: Yeah.

EMILY: This is bigger than a Crick bullywug…

CALDWELL: I point to them and say: Those are bullywugs!

[Murph & Emily laugh]

JAKE: Thank you, Beverly.

MURPH: So you can swing on ‘em if you want, or you can do whatever you’d like.

JAKE: Yeah, I’m fuckin’ pissed.

MURPH: Okay. [laughs]

JAKE: Greataxe coming out straight for this dude’s dome; try to split him in half from the head.

[Murph and Emily laugh]

JAKE: And… [rolls die]

MURPH: Oh, yeah! You hit!

JAKE: Fuck yeah.

CALDWELL: Hell yeah, you hit! The dome-crusher!

MURPH: Seventeen.

[Jake rolls die]

CALDWELL: Oh, man.

MURPH: A nine — so you hit for thirteen total?

JAKE: Yeah.

MURPH: You do fucking cut this dude in half.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: OHH!

MURPH: You just smash this fucking frog!

JAKE: Yeah!

MURPH: The other one, like, fucking looks so scared!

CALDWELL: Big boy!

MURPH: That is Moonshine; you’re up.

EMILY: Okay, I’d like to cast Entangle, like, with the mangrove roots…

MURPH: There’s only one.

EMILY: Oh, there’s only one left!?

MURPH: — and one is dead. So these guys are not, like, y’know….

EMILY: Oh, sweet!

CALDWELL: This seems like a scouting party, or some sort of exploratory vessel!

MURPH: I think Beverly would be correct in assuming that.

CALDWELL: Yeah!

EMILY: I’m just gonna straight-up try to hit him with my scimitar; just keep it simple.

MURPH: Cool.

JAKE: Nice.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Moonshine runs up…

EMILY: [rolls die] Uh…

MURPH: That’s a two that you rolled?

EMILY: …that’s gonna be a two… but I am still gonna Halo of Spores him for three, ‘cuz I’m not Symbolic Entity, but…

MURPH: [crosstalk] Oh, do you— okay. You can still do that, even when you’re… got it. Okay. So you shoot some spores at this dude, and he does not like it. He does not like it one bit.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: Does he sneeze? [laughs]

MURPH: Uh… yes. He sneezes a little bit. Just a little— [soft sneeze sound]

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Beverly, you’re up.

CALDWELL: Okay. Hardwon, what’s your HP?

JAKE: I’m at ten.

MURPH: Looks like half.

CALDWELL: I’m going to kind of run up and latch onto his back.

JAKE: — and I hate when he does this… [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah. It’s never happened, but you know that you hate it. I’m going to use Touch Hands.

MURPH: Lay on Hands, you mean?

EMILY: [laughs] “Touch Hands!”

CALDWELL: Lay— no, Touch Hands. [laughs]

MURPH: Touch Hands. You’re just gonna touch him?

JAKE: [laughs]  — just wants to high-five.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, my God!

CALDWELL: Yeah, I high-five him and he’s healed.

MURPH: Great. I believe it’s ten health… you heal for twelve.

JAKE: I’m back! Thats full!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Dang! This li’l young’un is powerful! They don’t make young’uns like you where I come from!

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] Now it is the bullywugs’ turn. He’s gonna take another swing at Beverly. Or— not Beverly; Hardwon.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Wait— no, I’ll save that. Nevermind.

MURPH: [rolls die] This dude frickin’ dinked off your axe; you’re able to swing it back around and block this dude. [laughs] Hardwon’s back in control!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Whoa! Badass!

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] He’s back in shape, yeah. That’s good.

MURPH: — after getting his ass kicked by some frogs!

CALDWELL & EMILY: Uh-huh!

JAKE: Making a lot of noise and taking two spears…

MURPH: Yeah! Hardwon, you’re up.

CALDWELL: I do remain on his back.

JAKE: Hell yeah. Swinging for the dude’s throat! [rolls die]

MURPH: What is that— a fourteen total? Fourteen to hit?

JAKE: Yeah.

MURPH: That does not hit.

JAKE: Fuck me!

MURPH: This dude— You swing your axe, he blocks it; he has a shield. That takes us to Moonshine!

JAKE: Help me!

EMILY: Alright, Moonshine’s coming with her scimitar again!

MURPH: Do it up.

[Emily rolls die]

CALDWELL: Fourteen?

EMILY: That’s gonna be… eighteen?

MURPH: That’s gonna hit. Eighteen hits.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Ooh!

JAKE: That’s what’s up!

EMILY: [rolls die] Hittin’ him for three.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh…

EMILY: — and then another spore-ific kiss, so that’s six!

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: This dude’s fucked-up. He’s on death’s door. He looks pretty hurt. That’s you, Beverly.

CALDWELL: From Hardwon’s shoulders, I ready a javelin.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: So that’s plus-five to attack. Let me roll…

MURPH: Are you just gonna toss a javelin at him?

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] — actually… well, I already rolled it and it’s an eighteen. [laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] Okay, yeah, you do hit.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Might as well!

CALDWELL: Yeah. So I throw that — is that gonna be a hit?

MURPH: Yes, definitely.

CALDWELL: Alright, that is going to be a d6… [rolls die] — plus-five, that’s eight.

MURPH: Eight, okay. You javelin this dude.

EMILY: — it’s only plus-three.

CALDWELL: Uh… no— oh, yeah. So it’s a six, sorry.

MURPH: Okay, so six. So still, this dude was almost dead.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

MURPH: You see he was, like, coughing from all the toxic spores he inhaled… [laughs]

[Jake & Emily laugh]

MURPH: — just gets fucking javelin-ed through the head; he sticks to the tree behind him— [unintelligible crosstalk]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh, that’s awesome!

EMILY: [crosstalk[ Ohh!

CALDWELL: Is he dead?

MURPH: He’s super-dead.

CALDWELL: Okay, um…

MURPH: [crosstalk] Cool. So we’re—

EMILY: [crosstalk] Can I search his body for any interesting fungi?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah, we should do a search.

MURPH: Yes. You search his body. [laughs] He definitely does not have any interesting fungi on him.

EMILY: [unintelligible crosstalk]

JAKE: “— but he has some uninteresting fungi…”

MURPH: He does have— he’s got, like, a little shield.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Nah, I’ve got one already.

MURPH: He’s got a little wooden shield, he’s got his spear, and he also has a burlap sack.

JAKE: Ooh!

EMILY: Let me go through that sack!

CALDWELL: Yeah!

MURPH: You open up the burlap sack…

JAKE: “— hoping it’s mushrooms inside —“

MURPH: — and it is empty.

EMILY: Empty!?

CALDWELL: Uh, can we check the other one?

MURPH: The other guy also has a burlap sack.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: Why are they empty!? That’s weird!

CALDWELL: I just wanted to see if they had any, like, affiliation sigils — or perhaps, like, a tattoo — or any sort of, like, identifying marks that would give us any information about the larger clan?

MURPH: Nope.

CALDWELL: Okay. [laughs]

JAKE: They’re just bullywugs, man.

MURPH: They’re just frogs. [laughs]

EMILY: Just some frogs!

CALDWELL: Huh!

EMILY: I can’t believe their burlap sacks were empty!

JAKE: What were they going to put, then, in there?

CALDWELL: You know, I think these might be good for a jambalaya! [laughs]

[Murph laughs]

EMILY: Okay, if someone’s gonna talk about jambalaya, I’m gonna make a bonfire and make us some— [unintelligible crosstalk]

MURPH: [crosstalk] Are you making a fire right now?

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] Let’s not make a fire, let’s focus on the kids!

EMILY: Okay, that’s good; no, you’re right: the young’uns.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

JAKE: The young’uns.

EMILY: No, we need to do the young’uns.

CALDWELL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

EMILY: However, can I rip off one of their legs so I can later make a bullywug jambalaya?

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Frog leg soup?

MURPH: Yeah… I guess, like—

EMILY: Let me sniff at it and see if I think it’s, like—

MURPH: They smell so rank.

EMILY: [laughs] Okay.

MURPH: These guys are disgusting.

CALDWELL: Well, sure! You gotta cook ‘em first!

EMILY: I tussle Beverly’s hair and I say: I don’t think this is gonna be the best jambalaya base.

CALDWELL: Aw, darn! I’ll get that Cooking Merit Patch yet! Not today! [laughs]

EMILY: Yeah, you hang around with me, you’re gonna get a lot of patches.

JAKE: Alright, guys…

[all laugh]

JAKE: Alright.

MURPH: [laughs] Hardwon’s: “Focus up! Focus up, everyone!”

EMILY: Okay, let’s get them young’uns!

CALDWELL: Okay. Onward!

JAKE: Can’t be that mad at Beverly, ‘cuz he healed me.

[swamp ambience plays]

MURPH: You travel through the muck; you’re pushing, like, the hanging leaves out of your face. Hardwon and Moonshine: the mud is up past your ankles, and Beverly, you’re like knee-deep in it. [laughs]

EMILY: Oh!

CALDWELL: [laughs] Uh-huh. Can I ride on Hardwon’s back?

MURPH: Yeah! Is that cool with Hardwon?

JAKE: He hates it, but yes, he allows it.

MURPH: [laughs] Okay. He allows it.

EMILY: Oh, now you just trailed muck up Hardwon’s back! [laughs]

CALDWELL: Thank you, sir!

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: So you guys are following the tracks left by the bullywugs — it’s kind of easy; these guys are stupid and they just, like, left these big tracks in a straight line…

JAKE: [crosstalk] Right.

EMILY: Oh, can I go first? I’ve got Mask of the Wild, so I’m using that to, like, lead the group ‘cuz it makes it easier to hide when I’m in the woods.

MURPH: Great, cool. So, yeah; as you guys are traveling, Moonshine’s taking the lead — a little bit more stealthy than Hardwon was… [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: Hardwon is now focused carrying Beverly.

EMILY: I’m like ‘Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment’-level, like, Stealthing.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: Great. [laughs]

EMILY: [laughs] It’s, like, unnecessary. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Just, like, getting down in the muck, covered in freakin’ swamp-water…

[Emily & Caldwell laugh]

MURPH: So you guys are able to follow these stupid bullywugs’ tracks because they were pretty careless as they went through the mud, but then suddenly things get a little bit more difficult; it looked like they were all walking in a straight line, but now you see that the path kind of diverges.

You see, to the north, a giant puddle — like, a big puddle — followed by, like, a six-foot wall of mud and the tangled roots of, like, a mangrove tree hanging out of it. And you see broken roots and, like, little froggy footprints on the side of it, so you can see that some of them clearly, like, climbed the mangrove tree.

And you see, to the right, a path in the mud where it seems like something big was dragged.

CALDWELL: Hmm…

EMILY: Tell me about this puddle.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; laughs] “Let me at that puddle!”

MURPH: [crosstalk] What are you doing to the puddle?

EMILY: I would like to get to the edge of the puddle and just, like, look in…

MURPH: Cool.

EMILY: — to try and sense depth or what it’s made of or anything like that.

MURPH: Sure. It’s pretty murky — you’re not gonna be able to tell how deep it is by looking at it — but you can stick your foot in or you can put your hand in or something like that.

EMILY: I’m gonna stick my staff in.

CALDWELL: Oh!

MURPH: You stick your staff in; it is not that deep.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: Uh-huh.

MURPH: It’s, like, two or three feet.

CALDWELL: I want to inspect the, like… dragging trail to see if I can discern what was dragged.

MURPH: Sure. Go ahead, give me an Investigation check.

CALDWELL: Okay. [rolls die] That’s a… nine, plus two.

JAKE: Eleven.

MURPH: Cool, eleven. So you don’t see any, like, frog footprints or anything going this way.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh…

MURPH: You just see whatever was being dragged was so big that it sort of cleaned up behind it, and it’s just this one kind of mass that’s getting dragged.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] So it’s like a—

EMILY: [crosstalk] So do they, like—

JAKE: [crosstalk] Sounds like a big burlap sack full of kids to me!

EMILY: [laughs] I think so!

CALDWELL: [laughs] — or a sled, or something. Yeah, okay—

EMILY: ‘A sled’ is very optimistic. “Maybe the bullywugs just captured them for a sleigh ride!”

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: So I can’t tell if it was a creature, or, like, if it was a sack; I just know something big was dragged this way?

MURPH: That’s whatcha get with a ten.

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] Oh!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Fair enough. Hmm…

EMILY: Okay. Then, I guess, maybe we follow this, right?

JAKE: [crosstalk] Yeah, I say we follow the sleigh.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah, let’s follow it.

JAKE: [crosstalk] — or the bag.

MURPH: Okay. So you guys start going—

EMILY: Wait, what was that wall that they climbed up? There was, like, a muddy wall with mangrove…?

MURPH: There was— so, heading straight ahead, it was to the north; you saw that it was, like, the mangrove tree that was hanging off that six-foot wall with frog footprints going up it — like they climbed it — and then something big was going to the right.

EMILY: Okay.

JAKE: Oh! Maybe I could— I’m a good climber; I could Climb…

EMILY: I could also turn into a giant lizard, in which case I could climb as well.

JAKE: Oh, that’s true, too.

CALDWELL: We should follow the track, but I do want to see Emily turn into a giant lizard…

JAKE: We just have to see what’s over the wall.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

JAKE: We have to… so, like, why don’t we—

EMILY: Oh, well, then maybe we won’t use— if we just have to see what’s over the wall, maybe we just use your Climbing ability.

CALDWELL: Yeah, did you wanna check what’s over the wall before we proceed?

JAKE & EMILY: Yeah.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Cool.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Okay.

JAKE: Okay, watch this!

CALDWELL: Whoa!

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Give me a Climb check.

CALDWELL: Am I still on his back?

[Jake rolls die; all laugh]

JAKE: [laughs] Oh, no!

MURPH: [laughs] He just rolled a two!

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: I was still on his back…

EMILY: [crosstalk; laughs] Is he just grabbing onto roots and they all just break?

MURPH: [crosstalk] So you guys—

JAKE: [crosstalk]  Wait a second, ‘cuz I’ve got a plus-something there! …oh, that’s a six, I think, brother.

MURPH: [laughs] That’s a six!

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: So Hardwon very confidently leaps over the puddle, grabs onto the mangrove tree — a branch instantly breaks off and he falls back into the puddle, soaking himself and Beverly.

[Jake & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: I offer him…

MURPH: Go ahead and give me — both of you guys, give me a Perception check. Actually, all three of you give me a Perception check as you splash into the little puddle.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Okay.

JAKE: Of course.

[Emily, Jake & Caldwell roll dice]

CALDWELL: I got a…

EMILY: Seventeen!

JAKE: I got an eleven plus… yeah. Just a straight-up eleven.

MURPH: [laughs] Okay.

CALDWELL: [laughs] …why can’t I find it…? Oh, wait! Nineteen.

MURPH: Nineteen!

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: Okay! As you splash down in the puddle with Hardwon…

CALDWELL: Right.

MURPH: — you see, in the mud, a patch: a Cooking Badge.

JAKE: [gasps] Ooh! That’s juicy!

CALDWELL: Ohh… and I’m so tempted by this, because I don’t have that patch…

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: — and, like, my first thought — my first amoral thought — is just to affix it to my sash and claim it as my own.

[Jake laughs again]

CALDWELL: But I think better of it and say: Friends…

EMILY: I see this, ‘cuz we had just talked about it…

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

EMILY: — and I put a hand on Beverly’s shoulder and I say:

CALDWELL: [nervously] Uhh…

EMILY: You’re better’n this, young’un.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: You’re right. Friends… the Green Teens have been this way! This patch… [sighs] — this could’ve been Erlin, Cran, or Derlin.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: One of the three.

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] Who are…?

CALDWELL: They’re the only three in our troop that have this patch!

[Emily laughs again]

JAKE: So it was just in the puddle, right? We still don’t know if it was lost from being dragged, or climbed.

EMILY: So how desperate are we to see over this wall, or should we just—

MURPH: It was much closer to the wall than it is to the track to the east.

CALDWELL & EMILY: Ohh!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] So maybe… can I—

JAKE: [crosstalk] So we gotta get up over this shit.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Okay. So if I turn into a giant lizard, can I shuttle them over?

MURPH: It’s not a hard climb, he just rolled a two.

[all laugh]

MURPH: You don’t need to turn into a lizard.

EMILY: Oh— then maybe I’m gonna try to do it without even turning into— without even Wild Shape-ing.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah!

MURPH: Yeah, go ahead. Everybody just give me Climb checks.

JAKE: Watch this!

[Jake & Emily roll dice]

MURPH: Just beat a ten.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Is that Acrobatics?

EMILY: [crosstalk] Do we add Athletics?

JAKE: [crosstalk] Got it!

MURPH: It’s Athletics.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: Fifteen!

MURPH: You got it. You…

JAKE: I have—

EMILY: I look down at Hardwon from the top and I just shake my head. [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: [rolls die] I got a ten.

MURPH: Cool! Okay.

EMILY: [crosstalk] And I reach out a hand, to be like…

MURPH: Moonshine gets up there easily. Hardwon follows up, head hanging down…

JAKE: [laughs] “— dejected —”

MURPH: — and Beverly follows up easily behind Hardwon.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: [laughs] The only one who did not get up on his first try was Hardwon Surefoot.

EMILY: [crosstalk; laughs] After he said, “Watch this!”

JAKE: [crosstalk] Surefoot.

MURPH: Let it be known that Surefoot is the one who fell.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] That’s… so fucking true about me as a guy.

CALDWELL: Hardwon, the trick is to take it slowly and steadily!

MURPH: So, as you guys climb up, you’re able to pick up the tracks again — bullywugs were clearly here —

CALDWELL: Huh!

MURPH: — and you continue to follow for a bit. What order are you guys walking in? How are you guys proceeding?

EMILY: Me first! Still within Mask of the Wild.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Me last.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah, and we’re hanging back.

MURPH: So you guys are walking forward, following the tracks, and the muck is getting deeper and deeper.

EMILY: Hmm…

JAKE: Shit.

CALDWELL: Huh. Well, I’m back on Hardwon’s shoulders. [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Yeah, okay. You’re back on Hardwon’s shoulders.

MURPH: So you guys…

EMILY: [laughs] You’re like, [imitating Hardwon] “That’s why it affected my climbing… ‘cuz you actually kinda hurt my shoulder before, so that was why I couldn’t climb.” [laughs]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: I’ve got my spyglass out and I’m patrolling the area.

MURPH: Okay — spyglass. Go ahead and give me a Perception check.

CALDWELL: Okay. [rolls die] …that’s a three…

[Jake & Murph laugh]

JAKE: [laughs] He’s holding the ‘glass the wrong way!

CALDWELL: My spyglass is very muddy. [laughs]

EMILY: Can I do a Knowledge (Nature) about this rising muck?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah!

MURPH: [crosstalk] Sure.

EMILY: [crosstalk] If I’m like— if I know why the terrain is changing?

MURPH: Sure.

EMILY: [rolls die] Twenty.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Whoa!

JAKE: [crosstalk] Twenty, damn. You’re gonna know everything.

EMILY: [laughs] He gives us a twenty-minute lecture about swamp biology…

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] You taste the muck.

MURPH: [laughs] As you’re walking through this mud, you see, ahead of you, this pool of muddy water and the tracks stop. You think that that might be, like, quicksand.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh! Okay.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Okay.

MURPH: But you do see tracks up on, like, a hill ahead.

CALDWELL: Without burning my…

EMILY: Is there a way to get around that? Can we skirt that pool?

MURPH: You could take the long way around, but you’ll need to do some Nature checks and stuff to see if you can keep tracking the bullywugs.

JAKE: [unintelligible crosstalk]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Can we check— I wanna, like, Investigate…

EMILY: Can I— how big is it?

MURPH: It’s about twenty-feet across.

EMILY: Okay.

CALDWELL: Oh.

EMILY: Can I, then, cast Shape Water on it and freeze it? I have a thirty— it says thirty feet.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Oh!

MURPH: Yeah!

CALDWELL: Would we know if this was, like, magical quicksand, or if it’s just normal quicksand?

MURPH: You can try to Detect Magic on it if you’d like… [laughs]

CALDWELL: I don’t know if I want to burn Detect Magic on this puddle. [laughs]

MURPH: Gotta be honest with you: wouldn’t be a great use! [laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay.

JAKE: [crosstalk] “It’s just quicksand.” [laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, okay! But it does say ‘you can freeze the water, provided there are no creatures in it.’

CALDWELL: Hmm!

MURPH: Are there creatures in it?

EMILY: Well…

CALDWELL: Should we yell at the puddle? [laughs]

EMILY: Can I stick my staff in and see if there’s…?

CALDWELL: [shouting] Are there any… Anyone in there!?

MURPH: You stick your staff into the muddy water… [rolls die] You do not immediately feel anything.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: Okay, then I guess I’m gonna cast Shape Water.

CALDWELL: Yeah!

EMILY: It’s only a cantrip, so I’m gonna cast Shape Water and try and freeze it.

MURPH: So Moonshine summons the elements, and you see…

[Caldwell exhales breath]

EMILY: [chanting] Melora! Oh, Melora! Melora!

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] — frost coming off of her hands as she shoots, like, a ray…

EMILY: I play my washboard to summon… [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Sure.

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: She strums her washboard…

[Jake & Emily laugh]

MURPH: — in a beautiful, icy tune.

EMILY: Shamanic.

MURPH: You see muddy water freeze, and then a giant fucking snake burst out of it.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Ohhh, shit!

JAKE: [crosstalk] Shit!

MURPH: Everybody roll Initiative!

JAKE: Fucking snake, dude!

EMILY: Melora-fucker!

CALDWELL: Not a magic snake, though.

EMILY: [rolls die] That’s gonna be a twenty!

JAKE: [rolls die] Good Lord, I rolled a one.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: Okay. [rolls die]

EMILY: [crosstalk] You’ve gotta swap out for some new dice! [unintelligible crosstalk]

MURPH: [crosstalk] Oh, my goodness.

CALDWELL: I got a twelve. [laughs]

MURPH: Okay.

JAKE: Fucking garbage, man.

MURPH: [rolls die] What’d you get? What’d you get, Moonshine?

CALDWELL: [imitating Moonshine; southern drawl] What you git!?

EMILY: Oh, I got a twenty.

CALDWELL: Ah!

EMILY: I got twenty!

MURPH: Moonshine, you go first.

EMILY: Okay. I would like to cast Thunderwave!

[battle music plays]

MURPH: Okay, go ahead.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Damn!

EMILY: He does a Constitution saving throw…

MURPH: ‘Kay.

EMILY: — or he takes 2d8 damage and is pushed ten feet.

MURPH: ‘Kay. [rolls die] He… got a nine; that’s probably not gonna do it.

EMILY: Nope.

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: Okay, uh… 2d8 damage…

MURPH: So how much— 2d8 damage?

EMILY: Yeah.

MURPH: Go ahead and roll.

[Emily rolls die; sighs]

MURPH: One… [laughs]

[Emily rolls die again]

MURPH: Eight. So nine, plus…

EMILY: So nine, and then he gets pushed ten feet.

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: — and then I’m also gonna… [blows kiss] — spore ‘im.

JAKE: Spore his ass, dude!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; laughs] Gotta spore ‘im.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Ya shock him, ya spore him…

EMILY: — for three more!

MURPH: Cool.

EMILY: Twelve, bitch! How big is this thing?

MURPH: He’s probably, like, fifteen-feet long?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Okay.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, shit!

MURPH: [crosstalk] He’s a big-ass— [unintelligible crosstalk] —snake.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Okay— how wide is he? Talk to me about girth; that’s what’s important.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: He’s thick. He’s thick as fuck. [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: It’s too thick, honestly.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Is he, like, veiny? All veiny? [laughs]

MURPH: [crosstalk] He’s as thick as your neck all the way around.

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] Oh, shit! That’s big!

MURPH: That is going to be you, Bev.

CALDWELL: Okay. Do I know anything about, like, this species of snake or any details and particulars?

MURPH: You can roll me a Nature check.

CALDWELL: Alright, cool. [singing] ♫ Nature check! ♫ [rolls die] ♫ That’s a one! ♫

[all laugh]

JAKE: Great.

EMILY: Dang!

MURPH: You don’t know shit. You did not get your Snake Badge.

CALDWELL: That lizard is missing it’s legs!

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: Alright, um…

MURPH: So, I will say:

CALDWELL: Yeah?

MURPH: You can kind of deduce, like… you guys have already figured out that you guys might sink if you go in this mud, so if you run in to slash this dude…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Right, but we froze it!

MURPH: You did not freeze it. It does not work when there’s an animal in there.

CALDWELL: Oh, okay.

MURPH: Yeah, so there was a creature in there.

EMILY: But I push him ten feet. Did that push him out of the water?

MURPH: No, he’s back in it.

EMILY: Okay.

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: It’s twenty-feet long. You can prepare an action that when he snaps at you guys, you swing at him.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh, I got you.

MURPH: You can do that.

CALDWELL: I think I’m going to throw a javelin. I’m gonna launch a javelin from Hardwon’s shoulders again.

JAKE: Nice!

MURPH: Cool, go ahead and throw it.

CALDWELL: Okay. [rolls die] That’s a… uh, that’s a six. Uh… plus-five, so… eleven.

MURPH: Eleven. You throw the javelin, it misses the snake, lands in the mud, and you just see it sink. That shit’s gone.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL & EMILY: No!

CALDWELL: And as a bonus action, I’m gonna cast Shield of Faith. So ‘a shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a plus-two bonus to AC for the duration.’ Hardwon, that’s gonna be you.

JAKE: What do I do?

MURPH: You get plus-two AC, so you’re at eighteen Armor Class for now. Cool.

JAKE: Awesome. Gracias, dude.

EMILY: Ooh, yeah!

MURPH: That is going to be the snake’s turn. He is going to snap forward at Beverly, who just threw the javelin at him.

CALDWELL: Ah-ha!

MURPH: [rolls die] And he rolls a fuckin’ one. So he just, like, fuckin’ face plants as Beverly scoots out of the way.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah! [laughs] This snake!

CALDWELL: [laughs] Wait, does his little tongue flick my face? [laughs]

MURPH: Sure, yes. Absolutely.

JAKE: That’s nice.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: In fact, you just like it. He just gives you a nice little lick and you think he’s just being friendly.

CALDWELL: Huh! Gave me a little snake kiss!

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: That takes us to Hardwon.

JAKE: What happens since I rolled that one? Do I…

MURPH: You’re last. So now you just go.

JAKE: Oh, I see. Great. [rolls die] Twelve plus four? What is it?

MURPH: Sixteen to hit.

JAKE: Yeah.

MURPH: No, no, no. You got an eighteen to hit. So yeah, you hit.

JAKE: Nice.

MURPH: Go ahead and roll your damage.

JAKE: [rolls die] That’s a twelve, bitch!

[all cheer]

MURPH: Twelve, baby! Twelve plus four, so sixteen damage. Damn. Yeah, you fuckin’ slash at this dude and—

JAKE: Could I do something with my two little axes?

CALDWELL: Oh!

MURPH: No.

JAKE: Okay.

MURPH: Unless, well, I mean you could’ve made your attack with your throwing axes. They do less damage.

JAKE: Fuck it, nevermind.

CALDWELL: No, no, no.

JAKE: It was big axe! It was big axe.

MURPH: You could twirl them if you’d like to just do something for show.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Yeah, yeah. That’s what I’ll do.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] So you slash him with your big axe. He rears back and screeches as you just twirl your axes like they’re drumsticks.

CALDWELL: I’m not gonna be satisfied until we Sephiroth this snake.

EMILY: Yeah.

MURPH: Cool. Okay, that takes us back to Moonshine.

EMILY: Okay. I will now use my cantrip Chill Touch.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: And there’s nothin’ chill about what’s gonna happen.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: ‘Kay.

EMILY: I’m gonna make a ranged spell attack.

MURPH: ‘Kay.

EMILY: Hope it hits. [rolls die] That’s gonna be twenty-one.

MURPH: That super-hits.

EMILY: And now he takes 1d8 necrotic damage. He’s not undead, is he?

MURPH: He’s not undead, he’s just a snake.

EMILY: Alright, well… [rolls die] — he takes three damage.

MURPH: He takes a big three damage!

EMILY: But — may I just say — a ghastly, skeletal hand came out and grabbed him?

MURPH: Oh, he’s spooked. He’s super spooked.

CALDWELL: [laughs] He did not like it.

EMILY: Also, the hand clings to the target until the next turn.

CALDWELL: So the—

EMILY: So it’s clinging to him.

CALDWELL: So a ghastly skeletal hand just kind of lightly slaps him?

MURPH: Yup.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay.

EMILY: Just gives him a wet willy.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: An icy willy.

CALDWELL: [imitating an annoyed victim of a wet willy] “Stop!”

MURPH: That takes us to Bev.

JAKE: Come on, Bev!

CALDWELL: Okay. I feel like I’m just gonna—

EMILY: You’re our only hope, Beverly! [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: Okay! I guess I’m just gonna try and slash at the snake. I’m out of spells.

MURPH: Okay, slash him.

CALDWELL: Let me slash at that snake.

MURPH: Take a swing.

CALDWELL: Alright.

MURPH: Take a swing, baby.

CALDWELL: I’m aiming for his gully.

MURPH: Cool.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] Sixteen, uh…

MURPH: That’s gonna hit automatically.

CALDWELL: Nice, cool!

MURPH: Yeah, roll your d8.

CALDWELL: D8! [rolls die] That’s a seven plus five.

MURPH: Twelve.

CALDWELL: So twelve.

MURPH: He screeches. He’s pissed!

CALDWELL: I did it!

MURPH: He sticks his tongue out at you.

CALDWELL: Guys, I made the snake mad!

[Emily & Jake laugh]

MURPH: That is…h boy, that’s the snake.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

JAKE: Snake time.

MURPH: He’s gonna try to bite at… actually, he’ll probably just try to bite Hardwon, because you’re on his back. So he’s not just gonna go for Beverly. [rolls die] That is—

CALDWELL: [laughs] Our plan is backfiring! Our tower of power is drawing unwanted attention!

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: That’s an eighteen to hit. And I believe that’s your Armor Class, so that is gonna hit.

CALDWELL: Wait… oh yeah, shit. Even with a plus-two.

MURPH: Yes. So he swings down and attempts to grab Hardwon.

EMILY: Oy yoi yoi.

JAKE: Good fuckin’ luck.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [rolls die] And he does seven— [rolls die] He does thirteen damage to Hardwon.

JAKE: Wow.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: That hurt.

MURPH: — and the target is grappled. So you are restrained.

CALDWELL: Great, okay.

MURPH: So he just wrapped himself around Hardwon.

CALDWELL: Good, good, good, good, good. Well, not good for Hardwon, but—

MURPH: Now it is Hardwon’s turn. Hardwon, you cannot make an attack this round. You can just try to get out of being constricted by this giant snake.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Cool. Flexing every fucking muscle in my body—

[all laugh]

[Jake rolls die]

MURPH: [laughs] He rolled a one!

[all laugh]

MURPH: Hardwon—

JAKE: Every time I fail, I say, “Watch this.”

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: I feel like Hardwon—

JAKE: Watch this!

CALDWELL: Murph, can you roll to see how much Hardwon shits himself?

EMILY: Wait, was that the right dice?

MURPH: Yeah, he rolled a one. D20.

EMILY: Oh, I was thinking a different dice.

MURPH: He yells, “Watch this!” And then just meekly goes: [groaning] “Unh!”

[all laugh]

MURPH: — and you hear a little fart let out as he tries to get out. [laughs]

[all laugh]

MURPH: That’s you, Moonshine.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Just a small toot.

EMILY: Okay, I’m just gonna make an attack.

MURPH: Cool.

EMILY: That’s all I can do. What’s your hit points at?

JAKE: I’m at nine.

EMILY: Oh.

CALDWELL: Ooh!

JAKE: But I have that potion that I could—

EMILY: Okay.

MURPH: You have a potion and you have Second Wind.

EMILY: Okay, I’m saving a first-level Cure Wounds for you, but I don’t know if I’m gonna use it quite yet.

JAKE: ‘Preciate it. And save everything you have, I’m gonna need it all.

CALDWELL: [imitating Hardwon] “Preesh!”

EMILY: I’m gonna try to get rid of this. So I’m gonna try and decapitate him with my scimitar.

MURPH: [laughs] Sure, go ahead.

CALDWELL: Very good.

EMILY: [rolls die] Fourteen.

MURPH: That hits.

EMILY: [rolls die] Six.

MURPH: Cool.

EMILY: And then… [blows kiss] — three more spores.

MURPH: Oh, wow. Okay. He’s pretty fucked up.

EMILY: Yeah, bitch!

CALDWELL: Back to Bev?

MURPH: Snake is upset. It is Bev’s turn.

CALDWELL: Alright, so—

EMILY: — but I didn’t decapitate him.

CALDWELL: Am I also constricted or am I, like, kind of… I imagine I’m—

MURPH: You’re out. You were able to jump off Hardwon as the snake came in.

CALDWELL: So what I’m gonna do: I’m gonna draw my sword, and I’m going to run along the spine of the snake. Kind of spiral up along the constriction.

MURPH: Okay.

JAKE: Aladdin-style.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: One-hundred percent Aladdin-style. And I guess I’m just gonna try and stab the snake.

MURPH: Cool.

CALDWELL: Wherever I can get a stab in.

MURPH: Yeah, go ahead and roll for Aladdin-style.

CALDWELL: Alright. [laughs]

[Emily & Jake laugh]

CALDWELL: I scream: Oppa Aladdin-style! — and no one gets it or laughs.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: Alright. [rolls die]

JAKE: — as I am fucking about to die.

MURPH: Hardwon farts again.

CALDWELL: Oh no.

MURPH: What’d you get?

CALDWELL: It’s a four.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Um, what’s my… shit.

[Emily & Jake laugh]

CALDWELL: It’s plus Strength, so it’s a nine.

MURPH: Nine, okay. [laughs] You run up and just slip off.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Hardwon just knows that Beverly could’ve saved him if he had just swung his goddamn sword.

CALDWELL: No!

MURPH: But instead he ran up and he yelled,”Oppa Aladdin-style!”, ran up and slipped off and he just farted. Shit yourself a little bit.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: I definitely fart as well, but not as much.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: I do a lighter fart. [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: Moonshine is just, like: “Oh, my God,” trying to keep up with you fucking idiots.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Okay, so this—

CALDWELL: Do I fall into the quicksand?

MURPH: No, no, no, no. You’re okay.

CALDWELL: Okay. [laughs]

MURPH: That was just for flavor. That was just for flavor.

EMILY: He’s beached. He’s beached.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh. I drown.

MUPRH: Okay, this dude is going to just fuckin’ squeeze Hardwon again.

EMILY: Oh!

JAKE: No!

MURPH: [rolls die] Okay, he doesn’t manage to, like—

CALDWELL: Nice!

MURPH: He’s squeezing and you’re fucking flexing your muscles so hard.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: This is a contest of will.

MURPH: So hard as you fight back. That is gonna be Moonshine again.

CALDWELL: Mhm.

EMILY: Okay. Moonshine’s gonna attempt to decapitate him again.

MURPH: [laughs] Everyone’s trying to decapitate him.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Uh-huh.

JAKE: Get a snake head! Get a snake head!

EMILY: [laughs] I look in the snake’s eyes, and be like: You know what we do with snakes down at The Crick? We turn ‘em into stew.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: And then she raises her scimitar! And… [rolls die; laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] She rolls a three!

CALDWELL: A lot of threes!

JAKE: Damn!

MURPH: You guys have missed so many times.

EMILY: And she… and she—

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: — she loses her grip of her scimitar as she raises it over her head and doesn’t do anything.

MURPH: Oh, I forgot, we—

EMILY: Oh, but I do blow spores! I still blow spores.

MURPH: You blow spores, okay.

EMILY: For three more damage.

MURPH: Okay, this dude’s actually looking real fucked up.

CALDWELL: Alright.

MURPH: Hardwon, you get to try to get out.

JAKE: Oh, yeah.

MURPH: You can roll another Strength check.

JAKE: [labored] Watch this. [rolls die]

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Seventeen!

JAKE: Seventeen!

CALDWELL: Alright!

EMILY: Woo!

MURPH: Burst out of the snake.

JAKE: Boom, baby!

MURPH: Hardwon escapes. That’s Bev.

CALDWELL: Huh. I guess I will also try— you know what? I’m not gonna try to decapitate it. I’m just gonna try to get as close to this snake as I can and swipe. I do want to cut it in half. [laughs]

MURPH: Okay.

JAKE: Dope.

MURPH: You guys are getting fancy for…

CALDWELL: Alright. [laughs]

EMILY: I know, we all turn into savages once we start—

JAKE: [crosstalk] People get real fucked up in this thing.

MURPH: It’s all for flavor, it doesn’t really matter. It’s just really funny to just be like: “I’m gonna cut it in half!” when Hardwon’s, like, dead.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Hardwon’s just like: “My arm is broken.”

[Emily & Jake laugh]

CALDWELL: I scream: This is for the Green Teens! [rolls die] It’s a six!

[Murph laughs]

EMILY: [laughs] We need to stop—

CALDWELL: Plus-five, so eleven.

MURPH: Eleven. Does that hit? That does not hit.

CALDWELL: Alright.

JAKE: Damn.

MURPH: You just barely miss the snake.

EMILY: We need to stop making fancy declarations.

CALDWELL: Yeah, we keep aiming for the bleachers and it’s not working for us.

MURPH: The snake is gonna try to bite Hardwon now that he got out. [rolls die]

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Ooh!

MURPH: Oh God, he hits.

[Jake gasps]

CALDWELL: Ooh!

MURPH: [rolls die] One… [rolls die]

CALDWELL: How many HP does Hardwon have?

MURPH: Hardwon, you take thirteen damage.

JAKE: Does that mean I’m dead?

MURPH: You’re knocked out.

CALDWELL: Oh, shit.

JAKE: Wow.

MURPH: Hardwon goes down in the mud.

EMILY: Oh, shit!

JAKE: Shit.

CALDWELL: Could we, like, administer a potion to him?

MURPH: On your turn, sure.

EMILY: I could also heal him.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: But I kind of want to—

JAKE: Just kill the snake; heal me afterwards!

EMILY: — the snake is close to death, yeah.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: Okay, Moonshine.

EMILY: Alright. I say, once again: You know what we do with snakes down at The Crick?

[Caldwell & Jake laugh]

EMILY: We chase ‘em out of our buckets.

CALDWELL: Every—[laughs]

EMILY: That we go toilet in. Okay.

CALDWELL: Moonshine, snakes don’t have ears!

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: He can’t hear you! [laughs]

EMILY: But maybe he can read my lips. [rolls die]

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: And then I hit him for seventeen!

MURPH: That hits! That hits.

EMILY: Yes, bitch!

CALDWELL: Okay.

JAKE: Just fuckin’ kill him!

EMILY: And then I go… [rolls die] — two, plus-two. Four.

MURPH: Four, okay.

CALDWELL: Alright.

EMILY: — and then I blow spores for three more.

MURPH: Okay. He’s super, super hurt.

EMILY: He’s not dead yet? Motherfucker!

MURPH: He’s not dead yet, but he’s super hurt.

CALDWELL: Can you just constantly blow spores?

EMILY: Yeah.

MURPH: She gets to every turn.

CALDWELL: That’s great! Oh, man.

EMILY: It’s my reaction.

JAKE: That’s awesome.

CALDWELL: Back to Hardwon or Beverly?

MURPH: Beverly, go ahead.

JAKE: I’m knocked down.

MURPH: [laughs] Hardwon’s down, dude.

CALDWELL: Alright.

EMILY: I’m just, like, in this—

MURPH: Although you will have to roll Death saving throws to see how you’re recovering.

JAKE: Oh, shit.

EMILY: I’m just in this snake’s face blowing spores at him while he is surrounding Hardwon.

CALDWELL: Moonshine’s got the snake. I’m gonna run over to Hardwon and cradle his enormous head in my hands— [laughs] — and, I guess, try and administer this potion to him.

MURPH: Cool. 2d4 plus two HP to our friend Hardwon.

CALDWELL: 2d4, okay. [rolls die]

MURPH: Four!

CALDWELL: Four!

MURPH: Alright, and keep rolling.

EMILY: Oh, she gave us really good potions.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] six…

MURPH: Six, plus two. Eight. Okay, so you come back to life with eight HP.

CALDWELL: Okay. Back up!

JAKE: [laughs] Alright! Maybe I’ll do my health potion on myself now.

MURPH: It is not your turn. [laughs]

JAKE: Of course.

MURPH: It is the snake’s turn. And the snake—

CALDWELL: I say: Can you stand?

MURPH: The snake just bites Hardwon.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: What!?

JAKE: Why did you wake me up for this?

EMILY: It feels like he’s like got something for you.

MURPH: [rolls die] He actually misses Hardwon.

JAKE: Damn right!

EMILY: Yeah!

MURPH: Hardwon pops back up to life, instantly combat rolls out of the way.

[all laugh]

MURPH: After yelling, “Watch this!”

[Caldwell & Jake laugh]

MURPH: Now it is Hardwon’s turn.

CALDWELL: Great.

JAKE: Sweet. Hope I kill this piece of shit. [rolls die]

MURPH: Dope, that’s gonna hit.

CALDWELL: Oh!

EMILY: Yeah!

MURPH: Fourteen, roll your damage.

[Jake rolls die]

MURPH: You do twelve damage.

JAKE: Twelve, okay.

MURPH: Okay, tell me how you kill this thing. ‘Cuz it is dead.

JAKE: Hell yeah!

CALDWELL: Yeah!

EMILY: Oh, my goodness.

CALDWELL: [laughs] What a glory hog.

JAKE: Hardwon— [laughs] The slow stride comes back. Greataxe over the head, I go straight between his eyes…. and I say… What was it? Oppa snake-style?

[all laugh]

EMILY: Oppa Aladdin-style.

CALDWELL: Oppa Aladdin-style.

JAKE: Oppa Aladdin-style. Oppa Aladdin-style!

[all laugh]

EMILY: Hardwon doesn’t even know what it means, he just thinks it sounded cool.

CALDWELL: [laughs] What happens?

JAKE: [laughs] He’s gonna tattoo that afterwards.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: Do he split that snake?

MURPH: Oh, he splits that snake right in half.

CALDWELL: Yes!

JAKE: Right through his skull.

EMILY: Oh!

MURPH: Aladdin-style, whatever the fuck that means.

[all laugh]

EMILY: Moonshine immediately goes over and starts skinning some of the scales off so she can make a cute bandana. [laughs]

CALDWELL: Ooh!

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: Great. So as you guys—we’re gonna end this session with Oppa Aladdin-style; everyone covered in muck and snake guts, as Moonshine just starts digging into this giant snake.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] I would like to—

JAKE: [laughs] No, this is for your jambalaya. Don’t you already have a bullywug leg?

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: Ooh!

JAKE: Now you have a snake’s head.

CALDWELL: Yummy, yummy.

EMILY: Could I sniff it? Would this make a good jambalaya?

CALDWELL: Little snake meat.

MURPH: Oh, my God, no. They’re all swamp creatures. It would make terrible jambalaya.

CALDWELL: Well, you add a little spice to it.

EMILY: Okay.

MURPH: Okay, here. I’ll roll to see… [laughs] — if this will be a good jambalaya. I tell you what: if it’s a higher than a fifteen it will be delicious. [rolls die]

[all laugh]

MURPH: It’s a nine.

CALDWELL: It’s a nine. It’s gonna be edible!

MURPH: It’s fine. That’s all.

[all laugh]

JAKE: The jambalaya’s possible—

MURPH: And that’s gonna be, okay—

EMILY: Okay, we’re making a jambalaya!

MURPH: You guys are gonna make a jambalaya. Great.

CALDWELL: Soup is on! I’d like to take one of the snake’s teeth…?

MURPH: Sure, you can write it down.

CALDWELL: Alright, cool.

MURPH: Snake tooth.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: Snake fang.

EMILY: Uh, can I go through its guts and see if it was pregnant? [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Oh, shit! We should go through its guts and see if ate any of the—

CALDWELL: Oh yeah, that’s a good point.

EMILY: Oh!

CALDWELL: Are there any lumps in there?

MURPH: You go through its guts and it does not have any halfling children in it, no.

CALDWELL: Thank God.

EMILY: What about its own children?

MURPH: It did not eat it’s own snakes, no.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Was it a male or a female snake? [laughs]

EMILY: Oh, right, a snake wouldn’t be pregnant.

JAKE: Yeah, did it have a giant snake pussy?

MURPH: It had a huge snake pussy.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: I just… I mark that down. [laughs]

MURPH: Great, cool.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: Is it’s clit forked?

MURPH: Yeah, you have a—

EMILY: Is it’s clitoris forked like a snake’s tongue?

MURPH: Yeah, yup. That’s exactly what it is.

[all laugh]

MURPH: It’s a giant forked snake pussy. Go ahead and mark down snake pussy. You guys have a snake pussy.

EMILY: I’m just taking the forked clit.

MURPH: Yeah, great.

CALDWELL: I think by identifying—

MURPH: That’s disgusting.

CALDWELL: —the snake pussy, I do get my—

JAKE: Right into the jambalaya pot. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: —I do get my Snake Identification Badge.

MURPH: Alright.

EMILY: Whoever gets the forked clitoris in their bowl has good luck for a year!

MURPH: Oh, my God!

JAKE: Oh, God, I have it.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Okay, guys, please rate the podcast, because this is gold.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Let’s be honest. Give us that good rating. Follow us on Twitter: @JakeHurwitz, @caldy, @eaxford, and @chmurph.

CALDWELL: Yeah, that’s you!

EMILY: Yeah.

JAKE: Yeah.

MURPH: Anybody got anything else to plug? Listen to If I Were You.

JAKE: If I Were You! Yeah, baby!

MURPH: Listen to If I Were You with Jake and Amir.

EMILY: Netflix’s The Fall. [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: Watch Netflix’s The Fall. We all really like it, it’s good.

CALDWELL: Yeah! Crown’s good too.

MURPH: Watch Drawfee on YouTube.

CALDWELL: Yeah!

MURPH: And buy me and Emily’s book! Buy our book! Buy my book! [claps]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Buy our book! Buy our book! It’s just as good as The Fall.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: It’s called ‘HEY, U UP?: How to Turn Your Booty Call into Your Emergency Contact’. A satirical relationship-advice book, coming out February 13th. So please check that out, and we’ll catch you guys next time. May the Baba Yaga not take you this night, and may Bahamut keep you.

BRIAN MURPHY: Welcome back to Bahumia! I’m your Dungeon Master, Brian Murphy, joined by Jake Hurwitz, Caldwell Tanner, and Emily Axford.

JAKE HURWITZ: [as Hardwon; gruff voice] Hardwon—

EMILY AXFORD: [as Moonshine; southern drawl] That’s Moonshine.

CALDWELL TANNER: [as Beverly; high-pitched, excited voice] Hello!

JAKE: [speaking Spanish] Hola.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Is that Hardwon Surefoot’s…

JAKE: Actually, Hardwon does not know Spanish.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: How do you say ‘hello’ in Dwarven?

EMILY: “Languages: Dwarven and Spanish.”

[Caldwell & Jake laugh]

EMILY: But only because he worked in a Mexican restaurant. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] I know ‘quesadilla’ and ‘hola.’

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: You found a magical stone called Duolingo.

MURPH: Cool! So guys, let’s do a little recap and we can keep it loose and talk through it. Last session the party was at the Hungry Trout Inn and Tavern, that’s where you started—

EMILY: Mishka!

MURPH: — where you just decapitated some troublesome barbarian folk. Some of the townspeople and Mishka, the half-orc bartender, helped you hide the bodies.

JAKE: [crosstalk] We killed Kruk, is that right?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah. [laughs]

EMILY: Yeah, Kruk and Ganesh? No, Kruk and Guresh.

JAKE: Guresh.

MURPH: Guresh is not dead yet. Guresh is the head guy.

JAKE: Oh, Guresh is the big guy.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: Oh.

MURPH: Mishka told you that Guresh was the leader. You have not killed Guresh. You have not even met Guresh.

EMILY: Mishka was badass. Bitch fought a dragon.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] She did tell you that her and a group of townspeople had fought the dragon before the heroes ever came. So she is kind of a badass.

JAKE: Yeah.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: She explained to you guys that these barbarians were part of the Cracked-Tooth Clan, and that they were pretty much running the town. Then you had your boy, Scoutmaster Denny, took you to visit Shae the Druid at the temple. She was the gray-haired, ageless Druid lady. Who—

EMILY: [crosstalk] Coward.

JAKE: So hot.

EMILY: Oh, my God. I just, like, want to go to her yoga retreat in Belize. [laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] I want to live in a yurt with her.

EMILY: Oh, my God, yes. Me and Shae in a yurt, just wrapped up in yoga mats.

[Caldwell & Murph laugh]

JAKE: That’s what’s keeping you warm in the bog right now. Just that thought.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Just drowning in chia seeds.

MURPH: So she blessed you guys, she healed you up, and she gave you some Scrolls of Water Walking. But then you guys elected— instead of using the Scrolls of Water Walking, you saved them, you elected to take a boat across. You snuck by that barbarian Druid dude, then traveled to a dilapidated dock on the other side of the bay. You headed into the swamp to search for the missing Green Teens, who were dragged off by the bullywugs. You picked up their trail and managed to kill a couple of the bullywug scouts. I believe Hardwon chopped one in half?

JAKE: That’s correct.

MURPH: And Beverly stabbed one into a tree. [laughs]

CALDWELL: A javelin right through the heart. Yeah.

EMILY: I feel like you’re really glossing over some of Hardwon’s failures. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: I don’t remember those.

MURPH: [laughs] Those haven’t happened yet.

JAKE: [rushed] Those came up— no, no, no, let’s continue with the recap. Like, really…

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: He was hit by two spears before that.

JAKE: Was he?

MURPH: You fell into a puddle later.

JAKE: I don’t know.

MURPH: Then you guys fought a giant snake.

JAKE: It was so long ago.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: That burst out of a murky pool of water.

JAKE: — and Hardwon killed the snake! Let’s get started with the episode!

[all laugh]

MURPH: Hardwon finished it off while yelling “Oppa Aladdin-style!” In reference, of course, to Beverly also yelling “Oppa Aladdin-style” earlier in the fight.

CALDWELL: Yeah. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Moonshine then cut up the snake—

JAKE: For a jambalaya.

MURPH: —to possibly make some jambalaya in the future.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah. Can we get a quick jambalaya recap? We have a frog leg…

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Yeah, you do have a frog leg.

CALDWELL: And some snakeskin, or just a big hunk of snake.

EMILY: Yeah. Snake, frog…

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

EMILY: You know, I think we—

JAKE: [crosstalk; unintelligible]

MURPH: This is gonna be a hell of a stinky jambalaya.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: It’s gonna be a real aquatic jambalaya.

CALDWELL: No rice, no veggies. Just meat.

JAKE: Hardwon is not hungry.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Okay, so let’s get started.

CALDWELL: Yeah!

MURPH: So you guys are in this swamp. You’ve just killed this giant fifteen-foot long snake, body as thick as Hardwon’s neck. There’s this pool of muddy water in front of you that seems to work like quicksand. Beverly lost his javelin there.

CALDWELL: R.I.P.!

Advertisement

MURPH: You guys have a pretty good idea of what happens—

EMILY: Is it not frozen? I had frozen it.

MURPH: No, it does not freeze because your spell doesn’t work if there’s a creature in there.

CALDWELL: Yeah, no it—

MURPH: So I was just, for dramatic effect, saying that the snake burst through the ice.

EMILY: Oh.

JAKE: But there’s not actually—

MURPH: But actually your spell fizzled for practical purposes.

CALDWELL: Right.

EMILY: Humiliating.

CALDWELL: For those keeping track, Beverly—

MURPH: For those keeping track, I didn’t make a goddamn mistake. Don’t @ me.

CALDWELL: Yeah. Also—

MURPH: I’m gonna… [laughs] Every time…

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Every time I don’t follow the rules perfectly, I’m gonna say, “don’t @ me.”

JAKE: Don’t @ me.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Absolutely.

EMILY: Can I… Can Moonshine do a look to see if there are any hanging vines around?

MURPH: Give me an Investigation check. You can see that there are hanging vines, obviously. But let’s see how much you see.

EMILY: [rolls die] Uh, bitch, that’s gonna be, a, umm… [clears throat]

CALDWELL: That’s gonna be numbers!

EMILY: Eighteen!

CALDWELL: Yeah!

JAKE: Alright!

MURPH: Eighteen, wow, okay. You can see– so you’ve got this murky pool of quicksand. You know, some World War I-type water-mud in front of you.

JAKE: Oh.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: You see — around the vines and stuff — you see that there are some branches broken and stuff. And it looks like some of the bullywugs may have climbed up and jumped across.

CALDWELL: Oh!

JAKE: That’s how they get across.

MURPH: — to some hanging branches on the other side.

JAKE: Okay.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: Oh, so there’s not like a Tarzan vine?

MURPH: There is not a Tarzan vine.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Dang.

MURPH: You would need to climb across monkey-bar style.

CALDWELL: Gotcha.

EMILY: Oh, okay.

MURPH: Kind of ‘hang and swing’. You’d need to do a little jump.

CALDWELL: Hmm.

EMILY: I could do a little jump.

JAKE: Yeah?

CALDWELL: Do you want to do a little jump?

Advertisement

MURPH: You guys would have to climb up first.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: Yeah, I’ll climb up.

CALDWELL: Yeah!

MURPH: Okay, give me a Climb check. Athletics.

EMILY: [rolls die] Sixteen!

MURPH: Sixteen, great! You scurry up that tree. You’re able to work your way across the branches. And there’s a little jump that you can make to get to the branch of a tree on the other side.

EMILY: Uh, well. before I do that. I want my compatriots to join me up here, probably. Unless you guys want me to do recon?

JAKE: Yeah.

CALDWELL: So we can’t just walk around the puddle?

MURPH: You could, but it’s so—

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: But it’d be pretty lame.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: — so the puddle… It’s not a puddle, it’s not a puddle.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

JAKE: [crosstalk] It’s quicksand.

MURPH: It’s a giant pool of water.

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: It goes twenty feet across to the other side, where you see the bullywugs tracks pick up again. And you see it, as far as you can see to the east, and as far as you can see to the west, it is going. So you can take the long way around, but you’re gonna need to do rolls for tracking, to see if you can find the bullywugs.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] I gotcha. Mhm. Okay. Alright.

EMILY: Y’all, who am I kidding? Okay, wait a second. I’m gonna drop… I’ve got PawPaw’s leash, I’m gonna drop PawPaw’s leash and I can help you guys up.

Advertisement
CALDWELL: Oh!

MURPH: [laughs] Okay, sure.

CALDWELL: We also have rope. I feel like we all have rope.

MURPH: Yeah, you guys do have rope too. But you can use PawPaw’s leash, why not?

CALDWELL: But no, no. PawPaw’s leash. Can you make, wait, wait, wait—

EMILY: [crosstalk] The flavor though.

JAKE: Let’s let Beverly hop up on my shoulders, reach PawPaw’s leash, and… [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] No, no, no, I have a question. Does PawPaw’s leash have a harness aspect on it? Is it, like, one of those—?

EMILY: Yeah, so it is attached to PawPaw.

JAKE: Yeah.

CALDWELL: Okay, so, oh — it’s… [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: So she’s lowering PawPaw. [laughs] You grab PawPaw’s—

MURPH: PawPaw is on his leash right now, right?

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: Yeah.

MURPH: So are you… is PawPaw… okay. So Moonshine—

EMILY: I can either lower PawPaw to you, or I can hold PawPaw and lower his leash.

CALDWELL: I’m gonna just—

JAKE: [laughs] But PawPaw cannot be unleashed.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Wait, okay, so are you hanging on to PawPaw’s leash, so you’re gonna be pulling up…? I guess you could pull up Beverly. He probably only weighs forty or fifty pounds.

Advertisement
EMILY: Yeah!

CALDWELL: Yeah, pull me up. Hardwon, you’re on your own. [laughs]

EMILY: Whoa.

JAKE: Godspeed.

MURPH: Okay, so PawPaw is on this leash.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: No, PawPaw is, like, in my overalls. And then I’ve wrapped the leash around one of the straps of the overall. And then I’m letting it down. So there’s sort of a belay—

MURPH: [crosstalk] Got it. Okay.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Smart.

EMILY: —safety to it.

CALDWELL: Ah, okay. I am going to strap myself into the harness.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Great. Beverly, like a good boy, clips into the leash. Give me a—

CALDWELL: Uh-huh. [shouting] Belay on!

[all laugh]

JAKE: Hardwon is just like: Shh! Shh!

MURPH: [imitating Beverly] “Ready, proceed!”

CALDWELL: I notice that you did a bad knot. So I fix your knot real quick. [laughs]

EMILY: I say: What are you fiddling with down there?

CALDWELL: Nothing! It’s just, I… some shoddy craftsmanship. But I have my Knotman’s Badge, so I’ll fix that right up for you!

EMILY: Okay, that’s real cute. Get on up here, child.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Here I go!

MURPH: [laughs] Okay, alright. So you’re climbing up with a leash? I guess I’ll give you Advantage on a Climb check. Go ahead and take it, buddy.

Advertisement
CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay.

EMILY: Yeah! ‘Cuz it’s a strong-ass leash. ‘Cuz PawPaw is muscular. He runs fast.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Alright, here we go.

MURPH: Yeah, PawPaw does try to run away all the time.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] Oh, that’s a ten, plus…

MURPH: Plus your Athletics.

CALDWELL: Oh, plus-five! Great.

MURPH: Great, fifteen. You scurry right up there.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Very nice.

MURPH: PawPaw starts lickin’ at you like crazy.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Suddenly he wants the leash now that he doesn’t have it.

[Emily & Jake laugh]

CALDWELL: Right. [laughs]

MURPH: And he starts kind of biting at ya. Kinda biting at the leash and pullin’.

CALDWELL: Ow! Oh, ow! No! PawPaw, please!

MURPH: Hardwon, that’s you, man. [laughs]

JAKE: Cool. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: He’s gonna roll a one.

EMILY: I shout down and say: Hardwon! Do you want the leash?

JAKE: I’m good! [laughs]

[Caldwell & Murph laugh]

EMILY: No, I dangle it down. I dangle it down in his face. [laughs]

JAKE: Hardwon ignores the leash…

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: — runs up, and, what do I roll? The twenty?

MURPH: Yeah, roll the d20, baby.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: I do, uh, plus my…

EMILY: You add Athletics.

MURPH: Plus your Athletics. Should be like a plus-six, right?

JAKE: My Athletics? Great. [rolls die] Okay, rolled an eight.

MURPH: [laughs] But that’s okay!

CALDWELL: [laughs] Alright, alright.

JAKE: But I got a plus-six, that’s fourteen.

MURPH: That’s a fourteen, cool. So Hardwon, not as easily as Beverly with the leash—

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

JAKE: [laughs; crosstalk] Oh, shit. He should’ve used the leash.

MURPH: — still manages to get up, with his pride mostly intact.

EMILY: Wow, Hardwon. Looks like the bark of the tree really scratched you up.

[Caldwell & Murph laugh]

JAKE: I’m fine.

EMILY: [laughs] You just got red marks all over you.

JAKE: [laughs] I’m a little too out of breath.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: I do offer him a Band-Aid.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: So you guys are up in this tree now. You need to do a little jump to reach the branch on the other side — or else you will fall fifteen feet down into this pool of quicksand.

CALDWELL: Could we use our rope — our actual rope, not our PawPaw harness—

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: — and lasso over to the other branch?

MURPH: Yeah, go for it.

CALDWELL: Okay, cool.

EMILY: Ooh! And then we could make a zip-line?

CALDWELL: We can make a zip-line.

JAKE: Yep.

MURPH: Okay, so you’re, in a way—

EMILY: Let’s make a zip-line, bitch.

JAKE: I wanna ride the zip-line with my axe.

EMILY: Yeah!

CALDWELL: That’s good.

MURPH: So you’re gonna try to tie a little lasso?

EMILY: [crosstalk] I’m gonna ride with my scimitar and then break it. [laughs]

[Caldwell & Jake laugh]

EMILY: Just shaves it off.

JAKE: “You’re stranding us!” [laughs]

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Are you making a little lasso?

CALDWELL: Yeah, I’ll make a lasso.

MURPH: Roll me a Survival check, I guess?

CALDWELL: Okay. I think I’m good with that. Uh…

MURPH: You should be pretty good at it.

CALDWELL: Survival? Yep!

MURPH: You are a little Boy Scout.

EMILY: As a Green Teen, he should be.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] Ooh, sixteen plus three. Nineteen.

MURPH: Great, okay. Yeah, you make a little lasso.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

JAKE: That’s sturdy as fuck, man.

EMILY: Yes!

CALDWELL: Mhm. I do this, and I successfully make the zip-line, and I kind of solemnly whisper—

MURPH: You don’t successfully make the zip-line, my man!

CALDWELL: Okay, alright.

MURPH: You gotta throw the lasso now! Now make a—

EMILY: Oh.

CALDWELL: [laughs] God dammit!

JAKE: You made a really good lasso.

MURPH: It is a good lasso, you got a good lasso right now. You can throw the lasso with an attack roll. So just make a ranged attack.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] So that’s ten—

MURPH: You got a ten total?

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: Okay. So you throw the lasso. You see it go into the thickets of branches and leaves of the other tree.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: But it’s kind of hard to see. You pull on it—

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

MURPH: —and it seems to be pretty strong.

CALDWELL: Yeah. The knot—

JAKE: I look dubiously at your merit patch for Advanced Ropecraft.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: No, no, no! But the knots will hold! The knots! It’s all about the knots! [laughs]

[Emily & Jake laugh]

MURPH: Yeah, you pull it and tighten it.

[Caldwell grunts twice]

JAKE: I just think of Scoutmaster Denny saying: [imitating Scoutmaster Denny] “Good boy!” to you.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: I rip it off and give you the patch.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: Hold on to this until I need it. Until I’m ready for it.

JAKE: [laughs] You’ll earn it back.

EMILY: Yeah.

CALDWELL: [laughs] I’ll go first as a show of good faith.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: Cool. Do I need to roll again?

EMILY: Ooh, I’m worried about you!

MURPH: You— yes. Give me a Acrobatics check. Or, no. Acrobatics or Athletics. And do it with Advantage because you’ve got the rope there.

CALDWELL: Alright. I have a plus-five in Athletics, I’m gonna do that.

MURPH: Great.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] That’s a fifteen!

MURPH: Great.

CALDWELL: Cool.

MURPH: You’re able to scurry across.

CALDWELL: Can I do a cheer as I go?

MURPH: Yes, you can.

EMILY: Oh, my God, why would you—

CALDWELL: [shouting] Scallee, scallay!

JAKE & EMILY: Shh!

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: Sorry!

EMILY: Child, I appreciate your enthusiasm—

MURPH: Bullywugs descend on you from all directions, quickly killing Beverly.

[all laugh]

JAKE: [imitating Beverly] “Scallee, scallooh!” [voice trails off; laughs]

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: So you scurry across, you get—

CALDWELL: It’s bad luck not to say it!

MURPH: — you get to the other tree. You’re able to move the leaves out of the way and see where your lasso ended up. You see it’s in a little bit of a precarious position — not on quite as strong of a branch as, perhaps, you would’ve liked. And if Hardwon or Moonshine had gone, perhaps they might have fallen.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Beverly, perhaps you want to, uh… Perhaps you want to tighten up that—

CALDWELL: Wait, can they see that I did a bad job?

EMILY: — secure that knot?

MURPH: They can’t see that you did a bad job.

CALDWELL: Okay, hold on. [laughs] So I quickly fix it.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: I give it a big tug and—

JAKE: [laughs] Hardwon says: Beverly, how’s it look over there?

CALDWELL: [laughs] All good down here! All good!

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: Is it sturdy?

MURPH: So you fixed it?

CALDWELL: I fixed it, yeah.

MURPH: Great, okay.

EMILY: Okay.

CALDWELL: Very sturdy, has always been sturdy, and remains as such!

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: So I took up PawPaw in my overalls—

[Caldwell & Murph laugh]

EMILY: —and I take my washboard, and I zip-line across.

CALDWELL: Oh!

JAKE: Nice.

MURPH: Really? Okay. Give me a—

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: You’re not gonna let her have it?

MURPH: I will let her have it, I will let her have it. [laughs]

EMILY: [laughs] That’s not a good ‘really’!

MURPH: Give me a—

EMILY: I’m just saying, it’s going to make beautiful music as I go across!

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: Okay, give me a Performance check? I don’t know how to deal with this.

[all laugh]

JAKE: Another beautiful song.

MURPH: [laughing] Would a washboard just… The metal just burns down the rope, and… [laughs]

CALDWELL: It’s so—

EMILY: [rolls die] Oh no, I’m doing the other side! I’m doing the other side, it’s vertical.

MURPH: [laughing] You’re doing the other side, okay.

JAKE: Wood on rope. That’s—

CALDWELL: It’s so crazy. As she does it, it’s exactly the melody for Semi-Charmed Kind of Life.

MURPH: Great.

[Emily & Jake laugh]

EMILY: I got eleven.

MURPH: Eleven, okay. It’s pretty impressive and cool. You do that thing that happens on zip-lines sometimes, where you start to go. and then you kind of stop– [laughs]

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: — and you have to swing yourself a little. So she is able to get herself across. But—

EMILY: But only because the weight of my huge, fertile boobs just like propels me forward. Helps me scooch.

CALDWELL: They’re. like. kind of… [laughs]

MURPH: You can see that maybe she could’ve died by doing that.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah. [laughs]

MURPH: But she’s able to lamely scoot across the very end of it, and she gets into the other tree with Bev.

CALDWELL: Mhm.

EMILY: It’s, like, a little too sexual as I hump my way across.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: Uh-huh. I feel like, yeah, you—

JAKE: [laughs] Hardwon pretends not to notice.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Do you like do that anime thing, where you slide in and squish up against me with your boobs?

EMILY: Oh yeah, yeah. It’s real pervy.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Beverly gets a nosebleed.

CALDWELL: I do get a nosebleed.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Instantly. God, I really do want to try doing the zip-line on the greataxe, actually. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: You can do that!

CALDWELL: Yeah, go for it!

JAKE: Okay, cool. I’m zip-lining on the greataxe.

CALDWELL: Hell yeah.

MURPH: [laughs] Okay. Not the bladed part, correct?

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: No, no, no, no. Just the wood.

MURPH: Okay, great.

JAKE: Wood on rope. What do I roll, the twenty?

MURPH: Okay, yes. I made her do a Performance check, but that was kind of silly. So let’s just say Athletics.

JAKE: [rolls die] I rolled a five. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Wait, so he also got an eleven!

MURPH: [laughs] Okay, you also got an eleven. Thank God I didn’t make you roll a Performance check, because you would’ve been in that quicksand.

[someone claps once]

EMILY: [laughs] Oh!

JAKE: Ooh-wee!

MURPH: So Hardwon does the same thing. He jumps up, thinking: “Oh! This looks like so much fun!”

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Starts to swing down, gets stuck halfway, and then awkwardly has to: [moaning] “Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!” across.

[all laugh]

JAKE: What is the…? Callooh callay.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Once again, I’m reaching out my hand, being like: Hardwon, just grab my hand.

JAKE: [strained] I’m good.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Just grab my hand!

JAKE: [harder] I’m good! [laughs]

CALDWELL: Callooh callay, Hardwon! You can do it!

JAKE: Callooh callay, Beverly.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Callooh callee! [laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] I give Beverly his patch back. You earned this now, son.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Ah, thank you. I quickly sew it back on with my sewing skills.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] It takes three hours. The Green Teens are dead.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Hold up—

EMILY: Oh, wow.

JAKE: I quietly remove the Sewing Patch. [laughs]

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: Okay, fair enough. [laughs]

MURPH: So you guys are in this tree on the other side of the muddy pool. Are you guys gonna try to climb down? Or… what are you gonna do from here?

EMILY: I would like to take a little look. I would like to survey the scene.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] That seems smart.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Yeah.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Mhm.

MURPH: Cool. Give me a Perception check.

CALDWELL: I lend her my spyglass.

JAKE: Very good.

EMILY: [rolls die] Ooh-hoo, bitch! That’s gonna be a… [clears throat] — twenty-three.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Twenty-three, nice. Okay.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Ohhh!

JAKE: [unintelligible crosstalk]

EMILY: That’s right. [crosstalk] Well, we have good eyesight down at The Crick.

JAKE: [crosstalk] You can see to fucking Galaderon from up here.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: So you see — it is difficult for you to kinda see anything, because there are all of these other trees around — it’s just, you know, a big thicket.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: It’s difficult for you to see, but you do see smoke from a fire north to you, and to the west, you can see the top of a castle.

CALDWELL: Mmm. A castle?

MURPH: Yeah, like a keep.

CALDWELL: Do we— so we don’t know about this castle. This isn’t like—

MURPH: You know, that the dragon Shadowfang lived in a keep—

JAKE: [crosstalk] — in a castle.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh.

MURPH: — in the swamp.

CALDWELL: Hmm.

EMILY: Okay, well… first off, y’all, we got smoke — and you know what they say about smoke: where there’s smoke…

JAKE: [crosstalk] There’s…

EMILY: — there are young’uns. [laughs]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Yep, when there’s smoke… yeah.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] What?

EMILY: Where there’s smoke—

JAKE: [crosstalk] That’s not quite what they say, but yeah.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Huh? [Laughs]

EMILY: — there are young’uns.

CALDWELL: [imitating a Crick-elf; southern drawl] “They love the stuff!”

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: Our young’uns down by The Crick play with a lot of fire. Anyways, so I believe—

JAKE: You guys are bad with children.

[all laugh]

JAKE: Go on.

MURPH: [laughs] “They play with a lot of fire!”

EMILY: Honestly, down at The Crick, they outnumber the adults…

[Caldwell & Jake laugh]

EMILY: — by about twelve to one…

JAKE: So they make the rules. [laughs]

Advertisement
EMILY: — so they make the rules. It’s—

CALDWELL: Wow, a place where kids rule. Sounds cool to me!

EMILY: It’s a scary place. [laughs]

MURPH: It’s so crazy that one day you guys are going to have to go to The Crick…

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: — and I just have to keep a running list of all the stupid shit Emily says.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: It’s like young kids playing with fire.

CALDWELL: It’s Children of the Corn, ‘cept— and there is a lot of corn.

EMILY: Second point of interest is that next to that there is the spire of a castle.

CALDWELL: Mhm!

EMILY: Now, I obviously know right now that it’s not—

MURPH: It’s a little— it’s kinda far away.

EMILY: Okay.

MURPH: It’s not exactly in the…

EMILY: So that’s not directly of interest to us right now… but perhaps it is something that, if we save these young’uns…

JAKE: That’s a g—, yeah, it’s safe for them at the keep.

CALDWELL: It could be a good place to hide out, in case of danger.

EMILY: Yeah.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] I made a little map.

EMILY: I mean, I love squattin’.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: I love findin’ just an abandoned house and just livin’ there for three to six months.

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: Alright. Strange hobby. [Laughs]

CALDWELL: That’s interesting.

EMILY: [crosstalk] So, I’ll tell you what—

JAKE: That’s a personal passion of yours.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: I live in a house with my mom and dad, but that’s a… that’s a way to do it.

EMILY: Yeah. Uh, so—

CALDWELL: Should we proceed to the north?

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah.

JAKE: Yeah, let’s go save the kids.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh.

MURPH: How are you guys at, HP-wise and stuff?

CALDWELL: Hmm…

JAKE: Oh shit. I think—

EMILY:  Fifteen, baby.

JAKE: I think I’m at nine?

MURPH: Okay, that makes sense.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, shit.

CALDWELL: I think I’m at… I don’t think I got hurt, during that.

MURPH: I don’t think you got hurt.

EMILY: Do we have any sort of concept of, like, how pressing this is? If we need to, like,  get to them right away, or if we could take a nap? 

CALDWELL: I feel like it’s as pressing as, like, kids are missing. [laughs]

EMILY: That’s pretty pressing, right?

CALDWELL, JAKE, & MURPH: Yeah, yeah.

JAKE:  There’s like the ritualistic sacrifice, and then—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Uh-huh.

MURPH: We’ve all seen The First 48.

EMILY: Okay.

MURPH: [laughs] If we don’t find the Green Teens within forty-eight hours… [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Although it would be fun to put up a little hammock in a tree. Have a quick siesta.

EMILY: Yeah, but we can do that once we find the Green Teens.

CALDWELL: Yeah. I could… well, hold on. I think I’m out of spells, so I don’t know if I can do a heal.

MURPH: You do not.

EMILY: I have one spell left.

MURPH: You are out of spells, right?

CALDWELL: Yeah.

JAKE: I’ve got Second Wind.

CALDWELL: Mhm.

EMILY: Okay, I have—

MURPH: You still have Action Surge as well.

JAKE: Oh, yeah.

CALDWELL: Oooh!

MURPH: You haven’t used any of your stuff.

JAKE: I just don’t really look at the paper.

MURPH: So it kinda works out.

JAKE: Hardwon’s too proud to ever accept help, even his own! [laughs]

MURPH: Everyone else had to use their spells to save your life—

[Jake laughs; Caldwell pretends to laugh]

MURPH: — because you weren’t using your own abilities.

EMILY: Moonshine currently has, like, a poultice of healing herbs that’s she’s trying to put on all of his bark rashes. [laughs]

JAKE: Yep.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Okay, great.

JAKE: Let’s go for it.

CALDWELL: Just pretty good?

EMILY: So I’m, like, doing a really good Stealthing, but I’m also humming loudly.

JAKE: Spores are growing everywhere, so it’s NOT that Stealth.

MURPH: Yeah, you’re unseeable, but you are singing a Crick song.

EMILY: Lullaby.

JAKE: And PawPaw is NEVER Stealth.

MURPH: Yeah, PawPaw is just goin’: [possum noises]

EMILY: — he thinks they’re armed.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: Oh, to see the world that PawPaw sees.

MURPH: You make your way through the swamp. You’re able to pick up the bullywugs’ trail, when suddenly in the distance you see the glow of this fire now…

EMILY: Okay.

MURPH: — so it’s safe to assume that you’re getting close to the camp.

CALDWELL: What — are we talking, like, campfire or bonfire?

JAKE: [crosstalk] — or a ritualistic sacrifice fire.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, yeah, maybe it’s a—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

MURPH: You’re not close enough, yet.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah, vinegar or sugar-based?

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: So go ahead and give me a Perception check.

CALDWELL: Mmm.

MURPH: I’m-a roll for somebody too… [rolls die]

CALDWELL: Jake, I like to think that Hardwon is saying all these things to Beverly, just being, like: [imitating Hardwon] “They’re fucking eating those kids.” [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: Uh, I don’t know! I think that…

EMILY: Yeah.

JAKE: Ruining your positive attitude.

CALDWELL: No, they’re probably trying to get a ransom for ’em or something.

MURPH: What did you—?

CALDWELL: Okay. [rolls die] Uh, fifteen…

MURPH: Great.

CALDWELL: — plus something.

JAKE: Yeah, what is it plus?

MURPH: It’s plus your Perception.

JAKE: Oh, Perception.

MURPH: Yeah, it’s one of your skills.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Aight. Huh!

JAKE: Of course, which I have zero.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Great, okay.

JAKE:  — and I rolled a six! [laughs]

MURPH: Cool. [laughs] So Hardwon just starts walking towards the fire, and Beverly stops him.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah, he just grabs— yeah.

EMILY: [crosstalk] What’s wrong with— do you have sweaty hands or something that are weighting the dice against you? [laughs]

MURPH: He’s holding a giant hammer in two hands, and he’s near a big, hanging, metal sheet.

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: Looks like some kind of improvised gong.

EMILY: Ooh!

MURPH: And, yeah, in the distance, you can see the fire, and you can hear some chatter.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: [whispering] Is it just me, or does this feel like the Jamboreen is happening?

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: [whispering] I don’t think is the Jamboreen.

EMILY: [crosstalk; whispering] Oh, okay. Okay, okay. Just wanted to double-check.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; whispering] We did have a big gong. We do have a gong at the Jamboreen.

JAKE: [whispering] This isn’t the Jamboreen!

EMILY: [crosstalk; whispering] Oh, Bev. 

CALDWELL: [whispering] It’s just… it feels like… now that she’s put the idea in my head, I see the gong…

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: [whispering] Just be quiet. Don’t celebrate.

CALDWELL: [whispering] Okay, alright. Alright.

JAKE: [whispering] It’s not the Jamboreen.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: [whispering] Now—

EMILY: Yeah. Yeah, Bev, no ‘Callooh Callee’s right now, okay?

CALDWELL: [whispering] Alright, okay. [groans]

EMILY: Silent. You can do a mental ‘Callooh Callee’.

JAKE: Calooh Ca-shhh.

CALDWELL: [whispering] Okay… alright, alright…

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [whispering] Now, I can tell by the way that that bullywug is standing, that it is in heat. So…

EMILY: Ugh! I know what that’s like.

MURPH: [laughs] You see him— he just picks his ass.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: [whispering] I don’t think that’s gonna affect anything, but just be wary.

EMILY: I dunno, as someone who’s in heat for most days of the year…

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

EMILY: I… It does affect you, you know.

[Jake & Caldwell laugh]

EMILY: Water retention and such. [laughs]

CALDWELL: Absolutely, I don’t—

EMILY: We maybe will be able to use it against him. [laughs]

CALDWELL: I don’t understand, and I— I would ask you to quit talking about it.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Same.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Okay! I’m just saying, you’re gonna smell instinctually, no? So… [laughs]

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] We know you’re fertile.

[all laugh]

MURPH: PawPaw just starts sticking his head into your armpits.

[Jake & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: You say it so much…

EMILY: I know! It’s, like, a warning. Anyways, go on, go on.

CALDWELL: Okay. Well, alright. [whispering] So, does anyone have any idea about what we should do? I imagine there’s more bullywugs around, but that’s the only one I can see.

Advertisement
JAKE: [whispering] We can’t let him ring that fucking gong.

CALDWELL: [whispering] Yeah, that would probably be bad. It either summons more bullywugs or starts The Feast of Pelor, which is an annual Green Teen Jamboreen tradition.

JAKE: It’s… not gonna be that one.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [whispering] I don’t know! I think it’s like fifty-fifty.

JAKE: He wi— [laughs]

EMILY: Well, he’s bored, so what if we made some noise out here to try and lure him in?

JAKE: Nice.

CALDWELL: [whispering] I like that!

JAKE: Yeah.

EMILY: [crosstalk] — and then we can kinda ambush him…

JAKE: [crosstalk] You got your—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; shouting] CALLOOH CALLAY!

JAKE: SHH! [laughs]

EMILY: Oh-ho!

MURPH: [laughs] Wait, did you really do that?

CALDWELL: I don’t… I don’t actually do that. [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: Alright.

EMILY: OH. OOH! Wait a second! Beverly!

CALDWELL: [whispering] Yeah?

EMILY: — you know so much about these bullywugs; why don’t you make a bullywug mating call? If he’s in heat…

JAKE: Ooh! Nice.

CALDWELL: [whispering] Yeah!

Advertisement
EMILY: — get him to come out!

JAKE: Do you have your Animal Mating Call Patch?

CALDWELL: I have dissected a bullywug, and we had some lectures.

JAKE: So it was dead. So it wasn’t making any noise.

CALDWELL: It was not making any noise, it’s true.

EMILY: But I’m sure….

CALDWELL: But I have some… Some of my dad’s friends like to go bullywug hunting, and one of them gave me a bullywug call, y’know, for my birthday. So I have some experience with it.

EMILY: Ooh!

JAKE: Sure. Let’s go.

MURPH: [laughs] You don’t have a bullywug call!

[all laugh]

MURPH: I’ll stand for the nonsense in The Crick…

CALDWELL: Alright.

EMILY: Okay!

MURPH: I’ll stand for the Green Teen traditions….

CALDWELL: Oh! I— So what I do is that I check my pockets. [whispering] Aw, dang it, I left it at home! But I know how to make—

MURPH:  It’s gonna be a Deception check.

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: So, whoever has the best Deception, just check it out.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Plus-two. What do you guys…?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Mhm. I’ve got plus-six.

JAKE: [crosstalk] I have only plus-two.

MURPH: You guys can also help each other.

EMILY: I can’t believe a Paladin… Well, okay, so—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Well, again, I’m a—

EMILY: — bullywugs down by The Crick— so if you do a mating call, I do a mating call; between the two of us, one of us is gonna get it right.

CALDWELL: [whispering] Yeah!

MURPH: [laughs] You’re gonna—

CALDWELL: Yeah, so it’s two girls for every guy!

EMILY: Yeah!

CALDWELL: Mhm.

EMILY: Ooh, we got b—

MURPH: You’re gonna do a mating call?

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

EMILY: To lure him out.

MURPH: …okay…!

CALDWELL: [laughs] Wait, no. I’m doing it. I have six in Deception.

MURPH: [laughs] Okay!

JAKE: This rest of the episode is… [laughs] — Beverly getting fucked by a bullywug. [laughs]

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] It’s just part of the patch.

JAKE: Mating calls, over and over.

CALDWELL: Alright. Yeah, no, I think that’s gonna, like—

EMILY: It’s just Hardwon and Moonshine in the bushes giving him a thumbs-up.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Okay.

JAKE: [laughs; whispering] “You’re doing great, buddy!”

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Alright, I—

MURPH: DC20 Deception check.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Wait, really?

MURPH: I’m not joking, he’s a fucking frogman.

CALDWELL: Right.

MURPH: He’s not gonna think a little boy making a frog sound is another frog that wants to fuck him.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: You’re gonna need to do a goddamn good job to trick him.

CALDWELL: Uhh… okay!

EMILY: Okay, so… Wait, wait, let’s talk about this, since you’re likely gonna fail.

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: Yeah.

[Murph laughs again]

CALDWELL: Fifty-fifty.

EMILY: [crosstalk] If you fail, at least the noise will probably get— he probably won’t—

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] I think what I’m gonna do, is I’m gonna, like—

JAKE: [crosstalk] Right. But couldn’t we also just, like, break a bunch twigs? [laughs]

[Caldwell & Murph laugh]

EMILY: No, no, no, I think this is—

[Murph laughs]

EMILY: I think this is a good option.

CALDWELL: No, Jake—

JAKE: Do we really need to make the bullywog horny? [laughs]

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: Jake, I’m gonna be—

JAKE: You can’t just fuckin’… “Clap my hands!”? [claps]

CALDWELL: I’m gonna be true to my character, and Beverly definitely likes to do things the hard, complicated way, because Beverly’s a little petty and likes to show his knowledge.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Alright, great, well… Hardwon is at least trying to talk you out of it as you do the bullywug call.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] No, no, no, no, no! I got this!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Hey, one last thing: I think we should also build a little trap.

CALDWELL: Yeah. Yeah, okay.

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: So is there’s a tr—

MURPH: How are you— you gotta take some time to build a trap, and you’re gonna need to roll Stealth rolls to see if you make noises.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay.

EMILY: Okay, in that case… maybe we’ll just hide, and we’ll ambush him when he comes.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] How about this— yeah. Yeah, I think if y’all—

EMILY: [crosstalk] —and the point is to just get him to come over and ambush him.

CALDWELL: Exactly. Alright.

JAKE: Alright.

CALDWELL: Okay. But I think that you are telling me that you believe in my abilities to do bullywug calls. [laughs]

JAKE: Great.

EMILY: Yeah.

CALDWELL: Alright.

JAKE: And I’m telling you not to do it.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: I think it’s a great idea.

JAKE: Just as Hardwon; as Jake: go for it, brother. [laughs]

[Emily & Murph laugh]

CALDWELL: Yeahhhh.

CALDWELL: I give y’all both thumbs-up, and then I contort my fingers into a weird flesh ocarina. And…

[Emily & Murph laugh]

CALDWELL: — prepare to bellow out this bullywug call.

[Emily & Murph laugh again]

MURPH: Alright, wait, wait, wait. Alright. I’m gonna give you—

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: I’m gonna give you… You can roll Advantage on this, but you still need to beat a DC20.

CALDWELL: Alright, cool, cool.

MURPH: —‘cuz I love the term ‘flesh ocarina.’

CALDWELL: [laughs] It looks so uncomfortable.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Okay.

CALDWELL: I’m like, pulling out my…

MURPH: [crosstalk] Alright, okay.

CALDWELL: This is, like, a fuckin’ jutsu.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Great.

EMILY: Oh, my God.

JAKE: And, remember: it doesn’t have to be super-loud.

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: Uh-huh! Well, I mean, for it to be accurate it would be, but I understand.

[Emily laughs; Caldwell rolls die; Jake & Caldwell laugh]

MURPH: What did he roll?

CALDWELL: [laughs] …I got a one.

EMILY: [crosstalk] One!

MURPH: He rolled a one! I gave you Advantage, so roll again.

CALDWELL: Alright.

EMILY: [crosstalk] So one more roll!

CALDWELL: [sighs] Aw, thank God.

JAKE: The next one’s gonna be a fuckin’ twenty!

CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] Aw, that’s a six. [laughs]

EMILY: Awh!

JAKE: [crosstalk] Okay.

MURPH: Okay, and what did you get?

EMILY: [crosstalk] So you got total twelve.

MURPH: [crosstalk] Er… what do you have total for Deception?

CALDWELL: Uhh… oh, plus-six. Yeah, twelve.

MURPH: Okay. You see the dude looks up… BANGS the gong.

JAKE: [Llughs] Okay.

EMILY: Awwww, fuck.

CALDWELL: Aw, goddammit!

MURPH: You hear the sound of the hammer against the metal, LOUD gong…

JAKE: I should’ve known that the gong was a warning.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Okay, should we scurry up in the trees?

JAKE: [crosstalk] I just thought it was a fuckin’ instrument.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; shouting] CALLOOH CALLAY! CALLOOH CALLAY! CALLOOH CALLAY!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Should we—

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: You see bullywugs start emerging.

CALDWELL: Mhm.

EMILY: Should we scurry up in the trees, and try to get some kind of advantage over them?

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Let’s get up the tree then.

EMILY: I’m going up in the tree.

CALDWELL: Yeah. I strap on the PawPaw harness, and go up the tree. [laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah.

MURPH: Okay, so give me some Climb checks to see if you can get there quick enough, while these bullywugs run into the forest to find you guys. [rolls dice]

CALDWELL: [rolls die] GODDAMMIT. [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Good Lord, no!

EMILY: [rolls die] We add Acrobatics or Athletics? We add Athletics?

MURPH: Athletics.

CALDWELL: I got a one. Plus, uh…

MURPH: You got a one.

EMILY: I got a seventeen.

JAKE: [rolls die] Wow. This is the first time I didn’t say “watch this” and I got a twenty-four.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Great.

EMILY: Ooh! [claps]

CALDWELL: Ooh!

MURPH: Hardwon scurries up.

EMILY: Whoa!

MURPH: Beverly faceplants in the mud.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

EMILY: [laughs] I got a seventeen.

CALDWELL: OOWH!

MURPH: You scurry up. So everybody—

EMILY: Awww, now I gotta— I can’t leave Beverly down there!

[Jake & Caldwell laugh]

MURPH: Everybody give me Stealth checks. Beverly, you give me one with Disadvantage—

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: —’cuz you’re face down in the mud.

[everyone rolls dice]

CALDWELL: I just got another one.

EMILY: Thirteen.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: Pelor has forsaken me!

JAKE: Uh, I only got a six.

MURPH: Hardwon bounds up a tree and tries to hide in between some branches, but—

JAKE: But he’s SO big.

MURPH: —but his legs are just hanging out.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: He thinks that, just because his face is covered, like a toddler—

JAKE: [imitating John Cena] “YOU CAN’T SEE ME.”

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: — he thinks he’s hidden.

EMILY: Moonshine mistakes his huge meaty legs for just another bough of the tree, and tries to climb them.

JAKE: His legs are trunks.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: So Moonshine is hiding behind Hardwon’s legs, and you can see her face.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: PawPaw doesn’t realize that you’re in danger, and he’s just walking around.

EMILY: Oh, I gotta deposit PawPaw out of—

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: I’m depositing him up in the tree.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: He’s staying up there. That little thing has probably like, one hit-point.

CALDWELL: “PawPaw, stay!”

MURPH: Okay. PawPaw scrambles up into the tree. As you guys go up into the tree, Beverly faceplants—

EMILY: PawPaw! Scramble!

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: PawPaw, git! Into the trees!

MURPH: As the bullywugs rush into the forest to find you guys, Beverly just covers himself in mud to kind of hide…

CALDWELL: [laughs] That is what I would do, yeah.

MURPH: You guys see seven bullywugs—

CALDWELL: That’s still really bad.

[Emily groans]

MURPH: — come out, and they find Beverly first…

EMILY: [crosstalk] Alright, I gotta Symbiotic Entity.

MURPH: [crosstalk] — and, Ewok-style…

CALDWELL: [laughs] Oh, no. They hoist me?

MURPH: — point their spears at you…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Ohhh, I got you. Uh-huh. [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh, surrounded by seven bullywug spears?

MURPH: — while you’re on the ground.

EMILY: Ohh. I’m gonna wait this one out, see how Beverly handles it.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: That’s cool. [laughs]

MURPH: M’kay. So you see they hold their spears to you. You see they look kind of freaked-out and confused; a bunch of them are mumbling in Bullywug real quick, being like: [as bullywugs; unintelligible gibberish]

CALDWELL: Yeah. [laughs]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Truly a disgusting language.  I try not to judge, but that tongue…

MURPH: [crosstalk] — and you see one sticks a spear up to your chin…

CALDWELL: Up to my throat, okay.

MURPH: — and in broken Common, says: [as bullywug; warbly and throaty] Are you here for the Jamboreen?

[all laugh]

MURPH: [broken speech] What are you doing out here?

CALDWELL: [laughs] I think I laugh. [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Okay.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Bad Beverly, bad Beverly!

CALDWELL: [laughs; crosstalk] I try not to — I cover my mouth instantly, but I do let out a little chuckle.

MURPH: [laughs] Okay, Beverly starts laughing.

JAKE: So impolite.

CALDWELL: [whispering] I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

MURPH: A bunch of the bullywugs — two of them — grab you, pick you up, and start walking you back.

CALDWELL: Mhm. [laughs] Okay.

JAKE [crosstalk] Shit. So we should either rescue him—

EMILY: [crosstalk] Wait, so where’s this—

MURPH: Yeah, so if you guys want me to do something right now, let me know.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

EMILY: I think so. I am going… I think we gotta go get him.

MURPH: Do you have spells?

EMILY: Well, no — I was gonna Symbiotic Entity.

MURPH: So you’re gonna turn into a Symbiotic Entity?

EMILY: Yeah, so you know it’s go-time.

JAKE: Let’s go!

EMILY: I don’t even have to say anything.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh. Do you think it’s like a Sailor Moon transformation sequence that plays when you do that?

EMILY: Yes, absolutely. Every time.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Cool. A spore-filled one.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah.

EMILY: — except instead of, you know, rock music or something…

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

EMILY: — it’s, like, bluegrass music. [makes banjo sounds]

[Jake & Caldwell laugh; bluegrass music plays]

JAKE: I’ll washboard.

MURPH: Make an attack.

EMILY: Oh, Lord. Okay.

MURPH: They haven’t seen you yet.

CALDWELL: As they’re dragging me away, I ask: Are we doing sack-races this year? Yes? No?

[Jake laughs; battle music plays]

EMILY: — and then I just come flying out of the tree with my scimitar on the closest bullywug — or, like, one of the bullywugs that’s holding Beverly. So landing on my scimitar.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Mhm.

MURPH: Go ahead and make an attack roll.

EMILY: Okay. [rolls die] Euch… that’s gonna be… eight to hit?

MURPH: Eight to hit — that does not hit.

EMILY: Eh, I didn’t think so. But I still Halo of Spores him!

CALDWELL: [laughs] There you go!

MURPH: You Halo of Spores him. Okay.

EMILY: It’s gonna be six hit-points, ‘cuz I am the fungal queen.

MURPH: Moonshine jumps out of the tree, she misses big-time with the scimitar; the bullywug moves out at the last second. They all let out a croak of fear: [croaking gulp]

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Oh, so that’s how it sounds! Dang it!

MURPH: — and she spits her spores at him. You see he coughs, and he looks very upset by this.

CALDWELL: Mhm.

EMILY: I cast Shill… Shillela! Shillelagh?

MURPH & CALDWELL: Shillelagh?

EMILY: Shillelagh.

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: That’s my bonus action, so next time I use my scimitar.

MURPH: Cool.

CALDWELL: Shillooh shillay!

MURPH: So you turn your scimitar into a shillelagh. Hardwon, if you wanna take an attack, you can do it in the surprise round.

JAKE: Hardwon was just about to whisper to Moonshine: “Let’s wait and see what happens!”

[all laugh]

JAKE: — turns, she’s not there, and he’s like: Alright. Fuck.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Jumps right out — greataxe over his head — swinging at the other bullywug that’s holding Bev. [rolls die] That’s an eight… plus— what is this? The six?

MURPH: Yeah, so fourteen.

JAKE: — fourteen.

MURPH: That actually does not hit.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Wow! [unintelligible crosstalk]

EMILY: [crosstalk] What!? Fourteen doesn’t hit them!? What the fuck are they wearing!?

MURPH: Oh, wait— he’s holding Beverly, he would not have his shield up, so it will hit him.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah.

JAKE: Woo!

EMILY: Oh, they got shields!? These little motherfuckers have shields!?

MURPH: Yeah. So go ahead and make your attack roll— your damage. [laughs]

JAKE: Alright.

CALDWELL: [laughs; unintelligible crosstalk]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Who the fuck sold shields to these…!?

MURPH: They have little wooden shields and stuff.

EMILY: Who is dealing arms to these swamp-heathens?

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: Definitely someone my dad knows.

[Jake rolls die]

EMILY: Woo!

MURPH: Okay.

JAKE: That’s a twelve!

EMILY: Oh!

JAKE: Plus…

MURPH: Plus four?

JAKE: — plus four.

CALDWELL: Ooh!

MURPH: Hardwon, after doing such a bad job hiding and looking like a dummy…

[all laugh]

MURPH: — does come out of the tree and slash this dude in half.

JAKE: Hell yes!

EMILY: Oh-ho!

CALDWELL: Just, like, straight-up in half?

MURPH: In half. This bullywug goes down.

JAKE: There’s something way more badass about cutting people in half than decapitating them.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah! Yeah, you’re talking about— is it horizontal in half, or vertical in half?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] You would think that I…

MURPH: [crosstalk] Beverly is covered in bullywug guts.

JAKE: I really would prefer it vertical in half. It’s kinda, like, the most badass way you can separate somebody.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Is it vertical in half, Murph?

MURPH: [crosstalk] Yeah. It’s vertical in half.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Okay. Ooh, I release some eggs. [laughs]

JAKE: [crosstalk] Yeah. [laughs]

CALDWELL: I scream: This is the second time I’ve seen this!

[Emily & Jake laugh]

MURPH: So, everybody roll Initative. Now we’ll go into the actual fight.

EMILY: Okay. Woo!

CALDWELL: Alright!

[everyone rolls dice]

EMILY: Moonshine’s lookin’ at… nine. PawPaw’s in the tree, by the way. Safe in the tree, tucked away in a leaf.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Safe and sound.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: I got an eight.

MURPH: Okay.

JAKE: I got fourteen.

MURPH: Hardwon, you actually go first.

JAKE: Good shit.

MURPH: So which guy are you going for?

JAKE: Oh…

MURPH: So there’s the one that’s pretty hurt that was holding Beverly that Moonshine hit, and there are five that have their spears and their shields up.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: Cool. I’m gonna turn around and swing for a healthy one; let Moonshine finish her guy.

CALDWELL: Mhm.

MURPH: Cool.

EMILY: Okay!

JAKE: [rolls die] — and I just rolled a… nineteen.

MURPH: That hits.

JAKE: [rolls die] — and then a thirteen.

MURPH: Cool. You fuckin’ chop this dude down.

JAKE: Good. Let’s decapitate this guy — just old-school.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Ooh, yeah!

JAKE: I say “Oppa Aladdin-style!” again.

EMILY: [laughs] “Oppa Mulan- style!”

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Hey, Murph — as these bullywugs die, could you give me, like, a little sample of what they say? ‘Cuz their voices are very funny. [laughs]

MURPH: Nooo! My motherrrr!

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] That sounded bad!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, dear. Oh… oh, this is not good; Moonshine has nothing but respect for family!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Especially mothers!

JAKE: [crosstalk] Hardwon spits on her face… [laughs] — while his mother is right next to him.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Moonshine is— oh, no!

JAKE: [crosstalk] Just wait; you’re next.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] My son!

[all laugh]

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, Lord, I think this is a family business! This is a mom-and-pop shop!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Oh, my God, they’re all related! [laughs]

MURPH: That’s actually Beverly. These fucking bullywugs rolled so poorly — you guys should be being punished for your behaviour right now. Fucking making bullywugs sounds to trick a goddamn bullywug?

[Caldwell & Jake laugh]

EMILY: [laughs] I think that was a great move. I have no regrets.

CALDWELL: It was a very good plan! I’ve just gotta work on being sexier! [laughs]

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: [laughs] Yeah, we’re gonna have to practice.

CALDWELL: Alright, okay. I have to Grapple, right?

MURPH: No, they let you go because they’ve been attacked.

CALDWELL: Okay, cool.

JAKE: Yeah, one of them’s dead, the other one’s back-to-back.

MURPH: So you are right next to the bullywug that Moonshine attacked—

CALDWELL: Mhm, yeah.

MURPH: — and there are now four behind you, because Hardwon killed one.

EMILY: — killed two, right?

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

MURPH: Well, he killed two; he killed the one that was holding Beverly, and he killed one that was in the group of five.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Greataxe is dripping blood.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Dang! I’m startin’ to believe that beard is real!

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] You give it a gentle tug. [grunts]

EMILY: [laughs] Oh, shit! I thought that was fake all along! [laughs]

CALDWELL: I guess I’ll just go for the one nearest me. [rolls die]

MURPH: Five.

CALDWELL: Uh… so nine.

MURPH: — nine! That does not hit.

EMILY: Damn!

MURPH: So you swing at this dude, this guy moves out of the way.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Mhm, mhm, mhm.

MURPH: He picks up his shield and spear, and they are going to take swings at you guys.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Dang it!

MURPH: So these four guys that are near Hardwon are gonna surround him…

EMILY: [crosstalk] Hoo… read that; they got fifteen AC? Ooh!

JAKE: [crosstalk] Oh, fuck, I forgot to use my Second Wind.

MURPH: Yes, you did…

CALDWELL: Please use that! [laughs]

JAKE: [impersonating Keanu Reeves] “My bad!”

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Okay, so they’re gonna attack. The first guy tries to bite Hardwon…

EMILY: Whoa, savage! Old-school!

MURPH: [rolls die] So thirteen is not gonna hit you, so the Bite misses…

JAKE: [crosstalk] Nope!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Ooh!

MURPH: — but then he gets to make a spear attack.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Slapped him with my hand.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Wow. You slap his teeth away! [laughs]

JAKE: Knock it off!

CALDWELL: Wait, Murph — frogs don’t have teeth.

MURPH: Uh, I don’t know what to tell ya, man; I’m looking at the fuckin’ Monster Manual and he’s got a goddamn Bite, so…

EMILY: [crosstalk] Bullywugs do! Bullywugs do.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk; laughs] They’re just gonna gum you.

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] Frogs don’t, but bullywugs do.

MURPH: [crosstalk] — bring it up with Gary Gygax. [rolls die] Sixteen to hit — is that gonna hit you? What’s your AC?

JAKE: Sixteen.

EMILY: Mhm.

MURPH: Okay. [rolls die] That’s seven damage to Hardwon.

EMILY: Oh!

JAKE: I’m fuckin’— I’m fucked up. That put me at a two.

EMILY: Oh, shit.

CALDWELL: [laughs] You still have that potion, though!

MURPH: Second guy takes a swing at Hardwon…

EMILY: Nooo!

CALDWELL: Hardy!

MURPH: [rolls die] — and he misses with his spear. Now he’s gonna go with his Bite — which, yes, frogs can bite apparently…

EMILY: Oh, my God…

MURPH: [rolls die] — that is a fifteen to hit. That does not hit you! Cool, so Hardwon dodges out of the way, barely, barely alive—

JAKE: [crosstalk] Backhand— he probably just, like, faints instead of ducks.

[all laugh]

JAKE: Hardwon passes out for a second, but that saves his life.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Yeah, you’re sort of ‘drunken master’-style— losing so much blood…

CALDWELL: Yeah. I just can’t stop thinking about a frog with human teeth now, and it’s really tripping me up.

EMILY: Just, like, a really nice smile? [laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah, beautiful. [laughs]

JAKE: God, who’s your dentist?

MURPH: Okay. [laughs] This next frog flashes a nice, toothy smile…

[all laugh]

MURPH: — as he goes in to bite Hardwon.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Your gum care is impeccable! They’re flawless!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Moonshine’s like: Dang! We don’t get that at The Crick!

MURPH: [rolls die] He goes to bite you with his fangs, and he misses.

[Emily sighs in relief]

CALDWELL: They’re not fangs, they’re just regular human teeth.

MURPH: [crosstalk; laughs] Just full human teeth!?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Just beautiful teeth. Like, we’re definitely like: “Do bullywugs have braces?”

[all laugh]

MURPH: They just look like little Chiclets.

EMILY: [crosstalk] One of them is wearing an Invisalign.

MURPH: [crosstalk] They’re beautiful. They’ve got a Hollywood smile.

JAKE: They use little reeds to floss. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: My teeth are garbage and I do have braces, so I’m very jealous of these bullywugs.

MURPH: [laughs] Okay. Tries to stab you with his spear… [rolls die; laughs] — and he’s going to succeed and do damage.

EMILY: Ohh! Hardwon’s going down! This changes the strategy!

MURPH: [rolls die] That’s two damage. What are you at?

EMILY: Zero.

JAKE: That puts me at zero!

MURPH: Okay. Hardwon goes down.

CALDWELL: Oh, shit! Goddamn it! [laughs]

EMILY: Do you got any heals on you?

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] I got a potion! Or, wait— no, I used my potion, but he’s got one on him.

EMILY: [crosstalk] But he can’t use it if he’s down.

MURPH: [crosstalk] The other one runs forward and goes after Beverly.

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: [rolls die] — and that is going to hit with his Bite. Yes, he does bite with his human teeth.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [rolls die] That’s gonna be three damage.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: Bev!

MURPH: — and then he’s gonna swing at you with his spear. [rolls die] That is a twenty to hit.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

MURPH: [rolls die] — and then he hits you for seven damage.

CALDWELL: Ten damage total! Cool, cool, cool. Good numbers!

EMILY: Come at me!

MURPH: Okay. And the other guy swings at Moonshine ‘cuz Moonshine just hit him… [rolls die]

EMILY: That’s about right! [laughs]

MURPH: — and he misses with his spear. Then he’s gonna go for his Bite… [rolls die] — and he misses with his Bite.

EMILY: Ooh!

MURPH: Back up to Hardwon. Hardwon, give me a death saving throw! If you fail three times, you die forever.

JAKE: [rolls die] A thirteen plus what?

MURPH: No, t’s not plus anything. You’ve gotta beat a ten, so you got a thirteen.

EMILY: So that’s a successful save!

MURPH: Ten or higher is a success, so you’ve got one success.

JAKE: Great.

CALDWELL: Oh, cool!

MURPH: You’ll stabilize if you get three successes; if you get three deaths, you will be dead.

[Jake rolls die]

MURPH: — so you don’t do it right now. You just do one each round. So you roll—

JAKE: Oh, great. Well, that’s really too bad, ‘cuz I rolled an eighteen the second time, so…

CALDWELL: Jake, we’d really miss you if you die here.

JAKE: I would kill myself. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Moonshine!

EMILY: Alright, Moonshine’s a little peeved because she’s in her fungus form right now, so her hospitality is at the wayside…

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah — and her ovaries are just thrumming.

EMILY: — and she’s so peeved that she’s got her shillelagh and she can’t use it, because she’s got to go over and Cure Wounds to Hardwon.

CALDWELL: Nice.

MURPH: Okay, this guy— you do have one guy right in front of you that’s gonna get an opportunity attack on you if you go over to Hardwon.

EMILY: This guy gets an opportunity attack…? [whistles]

MURPH: He’s right on top of you.

JAKE: Don’t worry about me.

CALDWELL: Hmm… [laughs]

EMILY: Okay. I’m gonna leave you for now.

JAKE: I’ll survive.

EMILY: In that case, I just Shillelagh this bitch.

[Jake & Caldwell laugh]

MURPH: [laughs] Okay. Swing your shillelagh at his head.

EMILY: [rolls die] Fourteen!

MURPH: That… does not hit.

EMILY: Agh! You fucking kidding me?

JAKE: What!? Oh!

MURPH: You swing your shillelagh up, he blocks with his shield.

CALDWELL: They’ve got shields!

EMILY: But it’s goddamn magical!

JAKE: Spore him! [laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Do spore him! Do spore him.

EMILY: — and then I just spore him.

MURPH: You spore him for six?

EMILY: I do my: [kissing noise] — my little kiss. My Sonya Blade kiss.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Cool. You shoot spores into his big, toothy mouth, and—

EMILY: I say: Bite this, bitch! [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] — he bites down, and a mushroom grows out of his head, and his head explodes. He’s dead.

CALDWELL: Nice!

EMILY: Oh! And a tear comes to my eye; the beauty of life and death. From death there is life.

MURPH: — and he yells: Nooo! I have childrennn! They’re right over there!

JAKE: [crosstalk] God, this is such a sad story.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, Lord…

MURPH: I’m just defending my hooome!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Oh, Melora, what am I doin’?

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] Bullywugs are just— they’re a family people.

MURPH: Quick— let me tell you my name before I die!

[all laugh]

MURPH: Bev, you’re up.

CALDWELL: Okay. I will run towards the bullywug closest to Hardwon to defend.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: I want to try something.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: You can give me that classic ‘Brian Murphy Yes or No!’ [laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] Sure.

CALDWELL: I pull out the snake tooth I took earlier…

MURPH: Okay…

CALDWELL: — and I want to try and stab one of the bullywugs with it to see if it’s gonna poison him.

MURPH: Cool, go for it!

EMILY: I mean, you are pretty powerful — probably more powerful than a poisonous snake tooth — but I like this.

CALDWELL: Yeah, but I feel like this will maybe threaten them.

JAKE: It’s also creative!

EMILY: Yeah.

CALDWELL: Yeah, it’s creative; I think that maybe they will see me do this, and be like, “Oh, he’s killed one of those big snakes. He’s not to be fucked with.”

EMILY: Ooh! You should hide it in your finger so they think that you just have a poisonous touch.

CALDWELL: Oh!

JAKE: [laughs] That’s cool.

CALDWELL: Yeah, I do that.

MURPH: Okay.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: Man of legend.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] Fifteen! Yeah!

EMILY: Ooh! Yeah!

MURPH: Okay, that does hit. Go ahead and roll me a d4 for dagger damage.

CALDWELL: Okay. [rolls die] That’s a two.

MURPH: Seven total?

CALDWELL: Mhm.

MURPH: Seven total, and then— yeah, sure. This one time you can roll a d6 for poison damage, but that’ll be all his venom.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Yeah, bitch! Yeah!

MURPH: I don’t know if that’s how venom works; it just stays on their teeth…?

JAKE: [crosstalk] Don’t ask—

CALDWELL: No, it’s stored in little cavities.

MURPH: Okay.

CALDWELL: I know this, [sing-song voice] ♫ because I have the merit badge. ♫

MURPH: [laughs] Alright.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Alright. [rolls die] I rolled a two.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Can I ask how you slap him? Do you, like, bitch-slap him?

MURPH: [crosstalk] So what is the total damage you’ve done?

CALDWELL: Okay, shit… seven?

JAKE: [crosstalk] Nine?

EMILY: [crosstalk] You’ve done nine.

MURPH: Okay, nine damage.

CALDWELL: Cool.

MURPH: So you stab this dude for nine damage…

CALDWELL: Mhm. Open-palm slam! [laughs]

EMILY: Yeah! [claps]

CALDWELL: Do you think I just slap him?

EMILY: Yeah.

CALDWELL: I think that’s what I’d do.

MURPH: He lets out a pained croak.

CALDWELL: Mhm.

MURPH: Nooo! It’s my birthdaaay!

[all laugh]

EMILY: Oh, good Lord!

MURPH: — and then he’ll do a Constitution saving throw.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs] I really don’t think we should be killing these dudes.

MURPH: [laughs; unintelligible crosstalk]

EMILY: Usually I like to whip up a nice stew for someone if it’s their birthday!

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [rolls die] Okay, he does not get poisoned, but you did some poison damage.

CALDWELL: Okay.

MURPH: Okay! So that takes us to the bullywugs. So there’s three that are gonna swing on Beverly ‘cuz he’s right there, and then the other one’s gonna go at Moonshine.

EMILY: Is he gonna turn around?

MURPH: [rolls die] So Bite first: misses… [rolls die] — spear: misses.

EMILY: Yeah!

MURPH: Second guy — [rolls die] Spear: misses!

CALDWELL: Yeah!

EMILY: Shit, you have an eighteen AC!?

JAKE: [crosstalk] Dodge, duck, dodge!

MURPH: [rolls die] Bite: misses! He just rolled so small! I just rolled a two, a four, a two, and a three.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] I am as the wind!

JAKE: [crosstalk] These bullywugs are morons!

MURPH: Beverly’s just doing a river dance, getting out of the way of… [laughs]

[Emily & Caldwell laugh]

JAKE: God, it’s beautiful.

CALDWELL: I’m taking cotillion!

[Jake & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Okay. This last guy’s gonna take a swing at Beverly… [rolls die] — and he’s gonna hit. I’m so sorry.

CALDWELL: Shit. Nooo! Brian!

MURPH: He hits with his spear… [rolls die] Ooh, it might— oh, it’s only two damage.

CALDWELL: Oh, great!

MURPH: So you take two damage, but he’s still gonna try and Bite ya.

CALDWELL: Eh.

MURPH: [rolls die] Cool. [laughs] So he goes to bite you, and you catch his teeth — his big, human teeth — on your shield.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Nice!

EMILY: [crosstalk] Ah, the idea of teeth on a shield makes me cringe.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Wait, Murph —

MURPH: [crosstalk] Yes?

CALDWELL: Do any of the teeth stay in the shield?

MURPH: “Do any of the teeth…” [laughs]

JAKE: Beverly does have a teeth collection.

CALDWELL: I’m starting a collection!

EMILY: [crosstalk] That would be so dope.

JAKE: [crosstalk] Walkin’ around the world with you guys and your mushrooms and your teeth…

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Yeah, he chips his big bullywug front tooth on your shield.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

EMILY: [laughs] And it gets stuck in the shield?

MURPH: [crosstalk; laughs] You have half a tooth. Bullywug teeth are now canon!

JAKE: [crosstalk; laughs]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yessss! I’m starting a craft project.

EMILY: You should keep it in your shield, though.

CALDWELL: Ohh, yeah!

EMILY: — so everyone knows that you’ve battled…

JAKE: — that you are not to be fucked with.

CALDWELL: I think what I’m gonna do, is I’m gonna, like, paste all of the teeth on top of my shield. It’s a little craft project.

MURPH: Well, why don’t you do that after you haven’t died?

CALDWELL: Oh, yeah; I’m just letting you know. [laughs]

MURH: Okay, cool. So this other guy is gonna attack Moonshine… [rolls die]

EMILY: I say: Bring it on!

MURPH: — and hits with his spear…

EMILY: Try ‘n fight me, bitch!

MURPH: [rolls die] — for two. He rolled a one on his damage.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: — and he’s gonna try to Bite you… [rolls die] Oh! He crits.

CALDWELL: Oh, no!

MURPH: [crosstalk] First crit of the show is on you guys!

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] What the fuck, Murph?

EMILY: [crosstalk] Good, I love gettin’ bit up. You think I haven’t ever slept outside and let the skeeters bite me? I ain’t afraid to get bit!

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [laughs; rolls die] Alright, he gives you a big, chompy, bullywug bite for five damage.

CALDWELL: Yikes.

EMILY: [laughs] Nothin’!

MURPH: Hardwon, roll me a death-saving throw, bud.

EMILY: Oh!

CALDWELL: Oh, boy.

JAKE: I can’t use the eighteen from last time?

MURPH: You cannot.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

JAKE: [rolls die] That was a three.

MURPH: Okay, that’s a fail.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: Oh, God. I saw it was a single digit— knowing you, I was like, “Dear Lord.” Dear Melora.

[Jake laughs]

MURPH: Hardwon starts gurgling on blood a little bit.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Okay.

MURPH: Things are looking pretty dire over there.

EMILY: Ooh!

CALDWELL: This isn’t good!

MURPH: That is Moonshine.

EMILY: Okay. So, if I wanna run over to Hardwon, they’re gonna get attacks of opportunity?

MURPH: One guy will.

EMILY: Alright! I gotta take it.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: Yes, I’m going over.

MURPH: Okay, so he’s gonna take an attack on you… [rolls die] — and he misses!

CALDWELL: Oh!

[Emily cackles]

JAKE: We are blessed!

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Thank you, Melora! Okay, and then I’m gonna Cure Wounds Hardwon.

MURPH: Cool.

CALDWELL: Nice.

EMILY: So Hardwon, that’s gonna be—

CALDWELL: When you’re in the Symbionic form, do you just kind of, like, feed him a mushroom?

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: Yeah, I do, like, good spores. I have bad spores that I do at the bad guys, and then good spores.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Yeah, good spores.

JAKE: Nice. Push it past the blood coming out of my mouth.

CALDWELL: One of them… They’re both green, but one is a slightly different shade of green. It’s very important that you know which hue is which.

JAKE: And it is very dark.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: [rolls die] Oh, that’s gonna be twelve.

CALDWELL: Ooh!

JAKE: Very nice, what does that mean?

MURPH: Twelve — you pop back up with twelve HP.

JAKE: And I have twelve HP!

CALDWELL: Back up on his feet.

EMILY: And then you know that dude that Beverly hit?

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: Yes.

EMILY: I — [blows kiss] — kiss of spores.

MURPH: How do you want to kill him? I’ll say, “Finish him!” That will be my thing.

EMILY: Well, I kill him with spores.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Finish him?

MURPH: Finish him.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: I guess I’d like to go over and kiss him on his toothy mouth.

[all laugh]

EMILY: And just basically vomit spores into him. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Gross.

JAKE: Everyone feels, like, almost jealous.

MURPH: He dies of mushroom vomit.

JAKE: Does he have any last words?

CALDWELL: Can I, can I—

MURPH: He says: My first kiss!

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: Yes! Ah, I was thinking the exact same thing! Yes, we did it! [laughs]

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: So sad for him.

EMILY: I, uh, I—

JAKE: But she is super-fucking-hot.

EMILY: — I wipe my mouth and say: You know what? That’s not a bad way to go.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: That’s not a bad way to go. I should be kissing all of them.

CALDWELL: Very important question, Murph. Do the bullywugs believe in heaven?

MURPH: Mhm. Yeah.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Yeah, do we have time… can I use my action to ask if they believe in heaven? [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] They say no and stab you in the head.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Okay, Bev, you’re up.

CALDWELL: Okay, alright, shit. Um…

MURPH: You’ve got three bullywugs left. They have not been attacked yet.

CALDWELL: And Hardwon is stabilized, that’s good.

MURPH: Hardwon’s fine.

CALDWELL: Alright.

MURPH: [laughs] Also has all of his goddamn abilities. Hasn’t used any of them.

[Emily laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] I’m either, like, cutting people in half and decapitating them, or—

MURPH: — or dead.

JAKE: — passed out and dying.

EMILY: But, truthfully—

MURPH: That’s kind of what fighters do.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Hardwon—

EMILY: Truly once you start to use your abilities, I think you’re gonna find that you stay up a little more. [laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Alright, we’ll see!

CALDWELL: [laughs] Hardwon’s got fucking… You’ve got one speed, and I like that.

JAKE: Yeah, I don’t even know what Great Weapon Fighting is.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Oh, that’s you can re-roll ones and twos on your damage.

JAKE: I’m a moron.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Yeah, feel free to do any level—

JAKE: Hardwon is not smart, and neither am I. [laughs]

MURPH: Feel free to do any level of research. Just any level.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Do any of the words on that sheet.

JAKE: Cool.

EMILY: Yeah, maybe people at home can just Tweet how to play the Fighter.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Do @ Jake. Do @ Jake.

JAKE: Do @ me. Do @ me.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

EMILY: Do @ Jake.

JAKE: Get in on the Reddit, tell me what to do.

MURPH: Bev, you’ve got three of these bullies.

CALDWELL: I’m going to position myself in front of Hardwon.

MURPH: ‘Kay.

JAKE: [laughs] I’m like: I don’t need it, I’m good.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: You see Beverly’s protecting two-and-a-half feet of you.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah, no, my fist clenches. My eyes shine with courage and determination. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: [laughs] He is Naruto.

CALDWELL: Yeah. [laughs]

EMILY: Yeah, I was gonna say: this is so anime.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [imitating Beverly as Naruto] “Get your hands off my Scoutmaster!”

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Yeah — [laughs] — that is what I say. But my voice does crack when I say it.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: — and then I attack the nearest one.

MURPH: Great, go for it.

CALDWELL: [rolls die] Nat20, baby!

EMILY: Ooh!

JAKE: Oh, shit!

MURPH: Nice! Roll two d8s, then just add your modifier once.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Looks like the Band of Boobs gots its own crit!

CALDWELL: [rolls die] That’s an eight!

JAKE: That’s a nat8!

MURPH: Nice!

EMILY: Ooh!

MURPH: [laughs] Nat8. The famous nat8.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: Ooh, he crit-ed with an eight.

CALDWELL: And a five.

MURPH: And a five. Okay.

CALDWELL: Critical eight!

MURPH: So thirteen—

EMILY: So thirteen plus your—

MURPH: —plus, what is your…

CALDWELL: Attack damage?

MURPH: Yeah.

CALDWELL: Yeah, plus-five. So eighteen.

MURPH: Dope. Oh, my God. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Young Beverly.

EMILY: [laughs] What?

MURPH: Beverly, finish him.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: I think Beverly’s Rock Lee from Naruto.

CALDWELL: Yeah. I say: [voice cracking] This is for Hardwon!

[Emily & Jake laugh]

CALDWELL: And I do straight-up—

JAKE: Hardwon’s like: Shh!

CALDWELL: I do straight-up Link from Zelda spinning slash.

MURPH: Nice!

CALDWELL: Mhm.

MURPH: Beautiful.

JAKE: Very cool.

MURPH: And you cut him in half.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh. I think I probably just like—

MURPH: And he says… [laughs] What do you do?

CALDWELL: Well I… how tall are they?

EMILY: We need to—

MURPH: They’re dwarf-sized. They’re like four-and-a-half feet tall.

CALDWELL: Okay, so yeah, I could cut them in half.

MURPH: Cool.

EMILY: If you want to send them my way I can kiss them.

[all laugh]

EMILY: Seems like, maybe something—

MURPH: Beverly also gives a kiss of death.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: I say—

JAKE: [laughs] Beverly kisses them but nothing happens.

MURPH: Beverly regular vomits into his throat and he chokes.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] And when they slide apart after I cut them in half, I say: Thanks, but I already have my Dissection Badge.

[all cheer]

JAKE: That’s badass, dude!

MURPH: Nice, that’s really good!

EMILY: Bev!

JAKE: Good boy.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Good boy.

CALDWELL: Thanks.

EMILY: We both pat his head and say ‘good boy’.

CALDWELL: Is it weird that I like this?

[Emily & Jake laugh]

CALDWELL: It’s weird that I like this.

JAKE: It’s good.

EMILY: Well, it’s because you’re doing it in a… for an honorable reason.

CALDWELL: That’s right.

JAKE: We’re gonna get you your Murder Patch, buddy.

EMILY: And also, yeah.

CALDWELL: Pelor shines upon — that’s not a real patch.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: It will be.

CALDWELL: That’s one of the forbidden patches. [laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] “It’s a patch of shame.”

EMILY: I’ll whip you up a Murder Patch.

CALDWELL: Oh, thank you. [laughs]

MURPH: So these bullywugs are gonna—

JAKE: Just start making up patches for him.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Alright, they’re gonna swing down on this little demon boy. [rolls die] And he misses with his first attack, and he goes to Bite. [rolls die] And he misses with his Bite!

EMILY: [crosstalk] That’s because he is so strong.

CALDWELL: They’re so intimidated.

MURPH: Other guy swings on Beverly. [rolls die] Misses with his Bite. [rolls die] And misses with his spear.

CALDWELL: Yeah!

JAKE: Nice, dude!

MURPH: That is Hardwon.

EMILY: Whoa.

JAKE: Great. I’m gonna use my Second Wind! [laughs]

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Great! Go ahead and roll a d10. Then you get that plus your Fighter Level, so you’re Level Two.

JAKE: You got it.

CALDWELL: This is so good, Jake. This is basically, like, you getting back up and being like—

JAKE: I wasn’t passed out!

CALDWELL: Yeah. [laughs]

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: You weren’t fighting at full strength before.

EMILY: [imitating Hardwon] “I didn’t pass out and wet my pants.”

[all laugh]

JAKE: Hardwon has pissed and shit his pants.

MURPH: Hardwon is covered in urine.

[all laugh]

JAKE: It’s muck! It’s muck! It’s just stuff from the swamp!

[all laugh]

MURPH: [imitating Hardwon] “Man, the swamp smells like shit.”

EMILY: [imitating Hardwon] “It’s just, it’s really, uh…” [laughs]

JAKE: [rolls die] Ooh, that’s an eight. Do I add anything to it?

MURPH: Great, plus your Fighter Level. So ten total. So you get ten HP back.

JAKE: Great.

CALDWELL: So for… [unintelligible crosstalk]

EMILY: Ooh!

MURPH: And that’s a bonus action, I think.

JAKE: That’s twenty-two.

EMILY: That’s a bonus action, so I believe you can still—

MURPH: I believe that’s a bonus action, so you can still make an attack.

JAKE: Very nice.

CALDWELL: So is Second Wind, like, he just takes off his weighted bands, and he’s got a little extra energy?

JAKE: I’d like to unbraid my hair.

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: Ooh!

JAKE: Shake out the mane. [laughs]

CALDWELL: Oh, shit!

EMILY: Oh, yeah!

JAKE: What do I roll on that?

MURPH: You can make an attack.

CALDWELL: Hardwon became Hot One.

[Jake rolls die]

EMILY: Ooh! [laughs] That’s his alter-ego.

JAKE: That is a twenty.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: Great, that hits.

JAKE: Greataxe, and…

MURPH: Go ahead and attack him Aladdin-style.

JAKE: Oppa Aladdin-style, hit him for a sixteen!

MURPH: Holy shit.

JAKE: I’m going greataxe, instead of, like, top-down, I’m going cock-to-head.

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[all laugh]

JAKE: It’s fuckin’… winded up like a yo-yo ‘around the world’ thing.

MURPH: Winded up, top-to-head. He feels everything. He’s conscious through the whole thing. He doesn’t die until the axe hits his brainstem. And you can see how much pain he’s in as his face contorts until he’s cut in half.

EMILY: [crosstalk] Was that the one that was—

JAKE: [crosstalk] That’s right. [laughs] Good, good, good.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Any last words from him?

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: No, the guy next to him says: Jesus Christ! That’s my dad!

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: [imitating a bullywug] “All of us were someone’s—“

EMILY: He’s not making any more children anytime soon!

[Caldwell laughs]

MURPH: Moonshine.

EMILY: Oh, okay. Uh…

JAKE: How many of these guys are left? One or two?

MURPH: Just one.

EMILY: Then I go to the guy who said, “That’s my dad,” and I say: You should be with your father.

CALDWELL: Wait, no!

EMILY: And—

JAKE: That’s hospitable.

CALDWELL: Should we, like, try to question him or something?

EMILY: It’s too late. [laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay.

[Jake & Murph laugh]

EMILY: And I, uh—

MURPH: She’s already said her line.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: I think, yeah. I ask that question, and as I’m asking it—

JAKE: [laughs; imitating Beverly] “Should we question him?”

MURPH: [laughs] “Should we question him?” “He’s dead.”

CALDWELL: [laughs] Okay.

EMILY: [rolls die] Fifteen.

MURPH: Fifteen to hit? That does hit.

EMILY: Ooh, baby!

MURPH: Do your damage.

EMILY: Okay, so I get to do lots of exciting damage.

CALDWELL: Let’s question him—

MURPH: [laughs] Lots of exciting damage.

JAKE: [laughs] To this poor, fatherless child.

EMILY: Okay — plus my spellcasting modifier, which is five — so ten — plus I get to roll an extra d6.

MURPH: For your Symbiotic Entity stuff?

EMILY: Yeah. [rolls die]

CALDWELL: I’d like to question him about heaven.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: Twelve, bitch!

MURPH: Twelve total?

EMILY: Yeah.

CALDWELL: Whoa.

MURPH: This dude is dead. Finish him.

EMILY: Okay, I’m gonna just disembowel him.

[all laugh]

EMILY: I feel like we’ve been playing… [laughs]

CALDWELL: [crosstalk] That’s gonna take—

JAKE: [crosstalk] As Beverly is just like—

MURPH: [crosstalk] Also a lot—

EMILY: I’m gonna take it and just do a nice, smooth — but shallow enough — cut that it doesn’t cut him in half, but instead just his guts spill out. [laughs]

CALDWELL: Oh, it just spills— [laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] Before his guts come out, I say: Beverly’s right. He might have some good intel.

[all laugh; Jake makes a farting noise]

MURPH: [laughs] Insides fart out of his stomach.

EMILY: [crosstalk] And then I say—

[all laugh]

MURPH: As Beverly disembowels him with his shillelagh, just shoves it up his ass.

[all laugh]

EMILY: Moonshine.

MURPH: Moonshine, sorry.

CALDWELL: As— Oh, go ahead, sorry.

EMILY: And then Moonshine says: Maybe we share that Dissection Badge.

[Jake laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs] Uh-huh. As she’s—

EMILY: I could get into badges.

JAKE: [laughs] She takes the patch off of him.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: No, I give it to her. I give her the patch and say: You’ve earned it! And as the frog’s entrails are bleeding out, I do go up and try and question him.

[all laugh]

CALDWELL: Who’s your leader?! Where are you keeping the Green Teens?!

[all laugh]

MURPH: His dead frog eyes stare at you.

JAKE: [crosstalk] What’s his response—

MURPH: A thousand years of horror in his eyes.

[all laugh]

EMILY: I’m gonna go through his guts to make sure it wasn’t an expecting mother.

CALDWELL: [laughs] It was a… Alright, yeah.

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: I live in fear of that.

MURPH: Yeah, there were twins in there.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Oh, God.

EMILY: [laughs] Wait, really?

JAKE: Cool. Can Hardwon decapitate them?

MURPH: No.

[all laugh]

MURPH: Yeah, go ahead. Keep wrecking his body.

CALDWELL: Hardwon, no, oh…

EMILY: No, no, no, y’all. I think we need to give— this was, everything they said—

MURPH: So, just so you guys know, you guys are out of battle now.

CALDWELL: Yeah.

MURPH: You do hear commotion.

JAKE: We gotta hide. We gotta get the fuck out of here.

MURPH: The whole camp knows that people are here. The gong went off.

CALDWELL: Okay.

EMILY: So we do not have time to do a proper burial. So we’re gonna come back later though.

CALDWELL: I—

JAKE: Kick some muck on top of ‘em.

EMILY: Yes, let’s kick— that’s a Crick burial. So, uh, everyone kick some muck as you run away and hide.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: [laughs] A very honorable tradition.

EMILY: [laughs] Yeah.

MURPH: So you guys are gonna run—

JAKE: A Crick burial.

MURPH: — how far away are you guys gonna go?

EMILY: I think we should run towards it, and hide at the mouth of the entrance.

JAKE: Yeah, when you are guarding near a fire, you get night-blind because you’re looking at the light from the fire.

CALDWELL: [laughs] Oh, yeah.

EMILY: Ooh!

JAKE: — and when you look at the woods you can’t really see as well.

EMILY: Yeah!

MURPH: Okay, alright. I won’t give them Advantage on their checks then.

JAKE: Thank you.

MURPH: That’s a good fact, Jake.

[all laugh]

EMILY: I think that we wanna—

JAKE: Read the Game of Thrones books, people!

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: [laughs; imitating a bullywug, or perhaps Roy Dotrice, the audiobook reader for the Song of Ice and Fire novels] “Where’s he? Night blindness!”

[Jake laughs]

EMILY: Yeah, I think we should try to run towards it, but, like, hide at the mouth of where they’d be running out.

JAKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, that’s really smart! They’ll run right past us.

EMILY: Yeah.

MURPH: Okay, go ahead— Okay, so you’re going near the tents. So everybody go ahead and give me a Stealth roll.

CALDWELL: We all hold newspapers up to our face, and run right past.

[rolls dice]

MURPH: You guys do—

EMILY: Oh, I got a one.

MURPH: Okay.

EMILY: But I have Mask of Wild.

MURPH: Okay, then that’s Advantage.

EMILY: Okay.

MURPH: So then roll again.

CALDWELL: This is a Stealth check?

MURPH: Yes.

CALDWELL: Alright.

EMILY: I got a two. [laughs]

CALDWELL: I got a—

JAKE: Oh, shit!

CALDWELL: Oh, boy.

MURPH: What’d you get?

EMILY: A two.

JAKE: I got a ten.

MURPH: And what did you get?

CALDWELL: I got a nine.

EMILY: [laughs] Oh, God!

JAKE: So we’re not that stealthy.

EMILY: We’re fucked, guys.

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Hey, I’m still Symbiotic Entity. I still got my shit going.

[Caldwell laughs]

JAKE: My HP’s back to twenty-two, bitch!

CALDWELL: There you go.

EMILY: Let me see how long my Shillelagh lasts for.

MURPH: Let me just give a quick recap of the chain of events that just happened.

CALDWELL: Uh-huh.

MURPH: Beverly threw his voice to try and sound like a female bullywug in heat.

[Emily laughs]

CALDWELL: Uh-huh. Oh, I sounded like a male, not a female! That’s what happened.

JAKE: That wasn’t the problem. [laughs]

[Caldwell laughs]

EMILY: Oh.

MURPH: Bullywug heard this, he was right next to a gong.

JAKE: [laughs] Beverly’s like: “‘Cuz my voice is so deep!”

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: Hit the gong, seven bullywugs go out into the forest. You guys manage to kill them after Hardwon is knocked out. You do not run off, wait for anything to die down, but rather, approach the camp—

[Caldwell & Jake laugh]

MURPH: —make a ton of noise, as you see seven more bullywugs, near the fire, clock you guys, including a bullywug king, with a makeshift crown and a little robe.

CALDWELL: Ooh.

JAKE: Swamp crown.

MURPH: You see he has a wooden crown that’s like shittily made with jewels pasted on.

[Emily groans]

JAKE: Wow. That’s the bullywug royalty.

CALDWELL: I want to—

EMILY: I want to see—

MURPH: And that is where we will end our session: with you guys definitely about to die.

EMILY: Oh, fuck.

[all laugh]

EMILY: Yeah, we might need to retreat.

CALDWELL: Thanks for listening!

[Murph laughs]

JAKE: Alright.

MURPH: Thanks everyone for listening. This is the last episode ever of Not Another D&D Podcast.

[all laugh]

JAKE: Not next week, or ever.

MURPH: Of course, listen next week to see how our heroes get out of this one!

JAKE: [laughs] Spoiler: they don’t.

[Caldwell & Emily laugh]

MURPH: But yeah, guys. Follow us on Twitter, @JakeHurwitz, @caldy, @eaxford, @chmurph is me. Be sure to rate the podcast, guys.

EMILY: Actually, maybe I should make a Moonshine Twitter. @MoonshineCybin. [laughs]

[Murph laughs]

CALDWELL: Absolutely, do a little—

JAKE: Yeah, you’ve got some good fan-art for that shit.

CALDWELL: —a little roleplaying on the side.

[Emily laughs]

MURPH: Yeah, thanks so much guys for the fan-art. It’s been amazing.

EMILY: Oh, my God, I love it!

CALDWELL: Check out the— there’s a subreddit, where fan-art is.

MURPH: Yes, r/NotAnotherDnDPodcast. That’s ‘D-N-D’, the letter ‘N.’

EMILY: Oh! And if you want to Tweet about the show, we have, via text-chain, decided it’s #NaDDPod.

ALL: NaDDPod.

EMILY: N-A-D-D—

MURPH: With two ‘D’s?

CALDWELL: Two ‘D’s.

JAKE: [laughs] Ooh, naddpoles!

MURPH: [singing; to the tune of P.O.D.’s ‘Youth of the Nation’] ♫ While I was taking the test, I took two to the chest! ♫ [stops singing] NaDDPod; P.O.D., dude. Youth of the Nation, try to keep up, everyone.
