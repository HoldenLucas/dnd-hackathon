Race: Crick-elf

Class: Druid

Physical Description: Moonshine is a "beautiful elven woman" with freckles and a Southern drawl. She wears overalls with mushrooms pouring out of the bib. She is accompanied by her possum companion, PawPaw.

Personality: Moonshine is friendly and sweet, described as a "sweetheart" who finds it "easy to make friends." She's also mischievous and a bit of a free spirit, wanting to "spread spores" and go on adventures rather than settle down and have kids. She has a deep connection to nature, particularly to fungus and decay, and her actions are often driven by this.

Backstory: Moonshine is from a matriarchal society of elves called the Crick-elves, who were ostracized by the high elves. Her people live in an area called The Crick. She feels pressured to become the next "MeeMaw," the matriarch who gives birth to all the young'uns. She's using the fact that "sumthin's amiss at The Crick" as an excuse to go on an adventure to avoid this responsibility.

Equipment & Skills:

Musical Instruments: A washboard and a blade of grass.

Companion: PawPaw Gump, a loyal possum.

Skills: She's a good cook, and her druidic abilities likely include creating traps from mud, as she describes.
